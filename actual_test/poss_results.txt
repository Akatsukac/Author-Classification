A new genetic test can help predict whether breast cancer will recur, providing a way to help women decide whether they need chemotherapy, researchers here said on Thursday. The test, details of which were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, was not completely accurate, a new study of its effectiveness found. But it represents another step toward ''personalized medicine,'' in which genetic signatures could be used to guide treatments tailored for each patient. Many women whose breast tumor is removed by surgery get tamoxifen therapy but debate whether to also undergo chemotherapy, which can have debilitating effects. Cancer recurs in only 15 percent of such women, but many do get chemotherapy. ''We do give too much chemotherapy in this country,'' said Dr. Melody Cobleigh, professor at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, who took part in previous studies of the genetic test. ''And the reason we do it is because we can't pick out the people who need it.''	0
