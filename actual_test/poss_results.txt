Chao, who serves as team physician for the San Diego Chargers, says that he sees ''a lot of injuries, a lot of guys playing with pain. But if I were a betting man, and you showed me Landis's X-rays, I would bet my house that he could not be competitive in the Tour de France. This is the hip of a guy who, if he were just a weekend warrior, would have problems with everyday living. But to be a top athlete? Where a 1 percent performance loss is a big deal? No way.'' As for Landis, he responds to the question in his customary fashion, which is to question it. ''Well, I'm doing it, so it must be possible,'' he said, his face flashing into the sharp, faintly incredulous expression he often gets when he talks about his hip. ''All the doctors have ever been able to tell me is that I should get a replacement when the pain gets to be too much. O.K., that sounds fine, but how much is too much? Can anybody tell me that? How much is too much?''	0
''Two people in the same office, and I really respect them both,'' Ms. McCreary said. ''They have no idea. There's nothing they can point to except for my age.'' Dr. Aydin M. Arici, director of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the Yale School of Medicine, said, ''Everybody would agree there's no agreement.'' Recurrent miscarriages have many causes, Dr. Arici said. ''For two-thirds of the known causes,'' he said, ''there is a specific treatment. Then you have about 40 percent where you don't know exactly what has caused it. So there are some empirically unproven treatments out there that are highly debatable.'' One theory explaining why some women repeatedly miscarry is that the immune system somehow fails to recognize and protect a pregnancy, and instead mounts antibodies to attack it. This idea has led doctors to try two treatments intended to to restore normal immune function. One is intravenous immunoglobin therapy, a blood product pooled from thousands of donors and used to regulate abnormal responses of the immune system. The other is lymphocyte immune therapy, which uses blood from a woman's partner to prompt her immune system to recognize a pregnancy.	0
Human studies are not as consistent as those with animals. In a study reported in the June issue of The Canadian Journal of Applied Physiology, Dr. Clarkson found that compared with women who produce little or no estrogen, those on oral contraceptives, which contain estrogen, experienced less soreness after exercise, suggesting that estrogen does have a protective effect. And at an academic meeting of physiologists and biochemists in April, Dr. Tarnopolsky reported on a study in which men showed greater inflammation, an indicator of stress, two days after exercising, although men and women showed similar muscle tearing immediately after exercise. ''The damage was the same for men and women, but the body's response seemed higher for men,'' Dr. Tarnopolsky said. On the other hand, more recent data collected by Dr. Clarkson showed no differences between men and women in the experience of soreness after repeated muscle extensions. The sex difference in soreness, if it holds up, suggests that women may be able to endure longer exercise sessions than men. ''Women may accumulate less damage over the course of a long event, which would enable them to perform better,'' Dr. Tarnopolsky said.	0
So fast food is fast in this other sense too: it is to a considerable extent predigested, in effect, and therefore more readily absorbed by the body. But while the widespread acceleration of the Western diet offers us the instant gratification of sugar, in many people (and especially those newly exposed to it) the ''speediness'' of this food overwhelms the insulin response and leads to Type II diabetes. As one nutrition expert put it to me, we're in the middle of ''a national experiment in mainlining glucose.'' To encounter such a diet for the first time, as when people accustomed to a more traditional diet come to America, or when fast food comes to their countries, delivers a shock to the system. Public-health experts call it ''the nutrition transition,'' and it can be deadly. From Complexity to Simplicity. If there is one word that covers nearly all the changes industrialization has made to the food chain, it would be simplification. Chemical fertilizers simplify the chemistry of the soil, which in turn appears to simplify the chemistry of the food grown in that soil. Since the widespread adoption of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers in the 1950s, the nutritional quality of produce in America has, according to U.S.D.A. figures, declined significantly. Some researchers blame the quality of the soil for the decline; others cite the tendency of modern plant breeding to select for industrial qualities like yield rather than nutritional quality. Whichever it is, the trend toward simplification of our food continues on up the chain. Processing foods depletes them of many nutrients, a few of which are then added back in through ''fortification'': folic acid in refined flour, vitamins and minerals in breakfast cereal. But food scientists can add back only the nutrients food scientists recognize as important. What are they overlooking?	0
Another researcher reported that some studies showed that women who had high levels of DDE, the DDT breakdown product, had more difficulty breast-feeding than others. ''We did see a strong effect of DDE, with women who had the least amount of DDE breast-feeding for 36 weeks on average compared to 9 weeks in the highest group,'' said Dr. Walter Rogan, epidemiologist at the National Institutes for Environmental Health Sciences. Dr. Steingraber said, ''We should be asking how can we get environmental contaminants out of breast milk.'' Since contaminants accumulate over a lifetime, experts say that pregnant and lactating women should limit their exposure. For instance, women should not have lead paint removed from their homes while they are pregnant or breast-feeding. They should not eat fish or seafood from contaminated waterways, like the Hudson River or New York Harbor, because the fish probably contain PCB's. Pesticides and fumes from nail polish remover, paint, paint remover, dry cleaners, gasoline and other chemicals should be avoided, the authorities caution.	0
It may explain why heart disease is often considered less of a problem for women than for men -- even though more women than men die of it each year, Dr. Nabel said. ''Perhaps in the past cardiologists have focused a lot on the heart and heart attacks and haven't focused sufficiently on strokes,'' Dr. Nabel said. ''Perhaps this will lead cardiologists, neurologists, internists and family practitioners to think more broadly about how cardiovascular disease really affects the heart and the brain,'' she added. Given that both strokes and heart attacks are caused by blood clots in the arteries, it is not immediately clear why aspirin are protective only against strokes in women. The explanation may have something to do with the size of the blood vessels that lead to the brain, which are somewhat smaller than those that lead to the heart, Dr. Buring said. Dr. Buring said recommendations for aspirin use by women who have not had a heart attack or stroke should be reconsidered in light of the new findings. ''We need to look at whether this additional complexity in women should be factored in in some way,'' she said.	0
The state of the science is not sufficiently advanced and most physicians don't even want to think about the prognosis. They don't even want to formulate what they think is likely to happen to the patient. And this kind of head-in-the-sand response may mean that physicians overestimate, for instance, the efficacy of their treatment. They may prescribe treatments thinking they are going to help patients when actually they may not.  Q. Let's suppose that the doctor has a good idea of what the future holds for a patient's illness. And let's suppose that the prognosis is grim. Should the doctor just blurt it out? Don't some patients want to cling to hope?  A. I am deeply empathetic to the demands and complexities of prognostication. Doctors in a sense find themselves in an impossible situation. The patients expect them to be honest, to be accurate and to be optimistic. You can't be all three. And this speaks to the problem of hope.	1
A growing body of evidence suggests that aspirin and other drugs that inhibit the same enzyme might protect against other cancers as well, Dr. Hawk said, though ''the most compelling and most consistent evidence involves colon cancer.''	1
In cloning human embryos and extracting universal stem cells, scientists in South Korea have taken a big step toward a tantalizing goal: growing tailor-made replacement tissues for people who are sick or injured. Imagine new cardiac muscles to restore a heart after a heart attack, insulin-producing cells for diabetics or neurons to stave off Parkinson's disease. But significant scientific barriers lie between this accomplishment and any actual therapy, experts said. Moreover, ethical objections have put such research off-limits to some scientists -- including the many in the United States who rely on federal money -- and lack of investment has felled many companies trying to develop cell-replacement therapies. The South Korean work is a step toward what is called ''therapeutic cloning.'' The work so far is ''proof of concept of cloning but it's not therapeutic yet,'' said Dr. Steven A. Goldman, chief of the division of cell and gene therapy at the University of Rochester Medical Center.	0
A. It's very rarely used. Most probably, you can find it at some academic centers in big cities. And, of course, for many medications, the research isn't in yet about which genes are important and why. But even where tests have been approved, insurers don't cover all the costs, and that's hindered this from growing. Most prescribers don't understand genetics very well. The fruits of the Human Genome Project have only been out for about five years, and a lot of doctors and pharmacists did their training before that. I've heard people say that medicine won't change until there are major lawsuits against prescribers who fail to use tests to individualize therapy. Q. How have the drug companies responded to the promise of pharmacogenetics? A. Unfortunately, they are not set up for it. The big pharmaceutical companies have a different business model. They make their money from blockbuster drugs that reach millions of people with standardized doses. They don't want their markets to fragment, which is the obvious effect of pharmacogenetics.	0
''This adds to the body of evidence that frailty is not an inevitable consequence of aging but is due to specific biologic mechanisms,'' he said. ''This adds to evidence that it is a definable syndrome.'' Dr. Ronenn Roubenoff, an associate professor of medicine and nutrition at Tufts and a senior director of molecular medicine at Millennium Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, Mass., said the findings fitted well with new and unpublished data from a study in Framingham, Mass. Dr. Roubenoff, an investigator in this long-running investigation of the health of more than 5,000 Framingham residents, said increased levels of inflammatory proteins predicted a loss of muscle mass, one signal of frailty. Some people, Dr. Walston and others said, seem to be pushed into a cycle of increasing debilitation, ending in frailty, by a chronic illness like heart disease. Others simply become frail, raising the question, Is frailty preventable? The answer, Dr. Hadley said, is ''we don't know.''	???
Lauren has hope, Ms. Stanford said, and ''a lot of that hope has to do with stem cell research.'' Some Democrats and scientists contend that the law sought by Mr. Romney would drive from Massachusetts talented researchers and biotechnology companies. Mr. Romney said that one of the 280 biotech companies in the state was conducting embryonic stem cell research and that it had plans to leave the state. Abortion opponents and Roman Catholic groups flocked to Mr. Romney's corner. Debate over the issue will become more pitched next week with a hearing on Mr. Travaglini's bill. Democrats, who say Mr. Romney has his eye on national office, suggested that he was adopting his position to ingratiate himself with social conservatives. ''There is evidence that this administration has a national agenda,'' Mr. Travaglini said. ''One could argue that this is consistent with that evidence.''	0
Dr. Joseph Sacco's young patient lay gasping for breath; she had advanced AIDS and now she was failing. Assessing her, Dr. Sacco knew her medical options amounted to a question of the lesser of two evils: either the more aggressive ventilator, on which she would probably die, or the more passive morphine, from which she would probably slip into death. But there was also a slender chance that either treatment might help her rally. He also knew that how he presented her options would affect her decision, the feather that would tip the balance of her hope scale. As Dr. Sacco, a palliative care specialist at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, spoke to the woman on that chilly morning earlier this month, her eyes widened with terror: no intubation. He ordered morphine. He agonized about his approach. ''She's only 23,'' he said later that day. ''Maybe I was too grim. Maybe I was conveying false hopelessness to her. Maybe I just should have said, 'Let's put you on the ventilator.' I may have spun it wrong.''	???
Nor is there any need for a doctor to take out a stethoscope every year and listen to your heart, to thump your chest each year or look into your eyes, ears and throat. Those time-honored procedures provide no medical benefit for the healthy patient with no symptoms, said Dr. Paul Frame, a member of the task force who has examined evidence for these procedures. Many doctors do a careful physical exam on a patient's first visit, to serve as a baseline, but on subsequent visits, groups like the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality say, patients would be better off if doctors spent their time counseling them on such things as stopping smoking, eating a healthy diet and drinking moderately, using seat belts and having working smoke alarms in their houses. ''When we're spending time doing things that don't potentially benefit people and skipping things that may be of benefit, that's a sign not only of waste but of misplaced priorities,'' said Dr. Russell Harris, an associate professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina and co-director of the prevention program there.	1
A new genetic test can help predict whether breast cancer will recur, providing a way to help women decide whether they need chemotherapy, researchers here said on Thursday. The test, details of which were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, was not completely accurate, a new study of its effectiveness found. But it represents another step toward ''personalized medicine,'' in which genetic signatures could be used to guide treatments tailored for each patient. Many women whose breast tumor is removed by surgery get tamoxifen therapy but debate whether to also undergo chemotherapy, which can have debilitating effects. Cancer recurs in only 15 percent of such women, but many do get chemotherapy. ''We do give too much chemotherapy in this country,'' said Dr. Melody Cobleigh, professor at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, who took part in previous studies of the genetic test. ''And the reason we do it is because we can't pick out the people who need it.''	0
Dr. Haseltine's departure in some ways echoes that of J. Craig Venter, who left the top spot at Celera Genomics two years ago as that company turned to drug development and away from genomics. Dr. Venter, however, was clearly pushed out. The two men, once business partners, have since become unfriendly rivals. Both are widely described as brilliant and driven, with big egos and a penchant for the grand statement. Dr. Haseltine, for his part, is also known as a Renaissance man and jet- setter. He lives in both New York and Washington, decorates the company's office with prints of famous artwork, and is married to Gale Hayman, who was the co-founder of the Giorgio boutique in Beverly Hills, Calif. Human Genome Sciences was founded in 1992 as the for-profit partner of a nonprofit institute set up by Dr. Venter to find genes. Dr. Haseltine apparently thought that this would be a shortcut to discovering drugs. His idea seemed vindicated when, in 1993, SmithKline Beecham, now GlaxoSmithKline, paid $125 million for access to Human Genome's genetic database.	0
''I got into the field 10 years ago, when there was still this lingering idea that psychological factors and gluttony or a lack of willpower were the underlying explanations for why so many people were overweight,'' Dr. Heymsfield said. ''Seven or eight years ago, the first studies came out saying that genetics is very, very important, but at that point most people felt that it would be one or two decades before we went from knowing that fact to a molecular discovery.'' With the discovery of leptin in 1994, Dr. Heymsfield said, ''People were shocked.'' That discovery came when scientists reported that leptin made genetically fat mice stop eating and become thin. The next year, the hormone was found in people. At first many researchers hoped that obesity would turn out to be a simple matter of a leptin deficiency: give the hormone to fat people and they will get thin. But it turned out that overweight people make plenty of leptin.	1
But even a cursory analysis of the study's methods makes you wonder why anyone would take such a finding seriously, let alone order a Quarter Pounder With Cheese to celebrate it, as many newspaper readers no doubt promptly went out and did. Even the beginner student of nutritionism will immediately spot several flaws: the focus was on ''fat,'' rather than on any particular food, like meat or dairy. So women could comply simply by switching to lower-fat animal products. Also, no distinctions were made between types of fat: women getting their allowable portion of fat from olive oil or fish were lumped together with woman getting their fat from low-fat cheese or chicken breasts or margarine. Why? Because when the study was designed 16 years ago, the whole notion of ''good fats'' was not yet on the scientific scope. Scientists study what scientists can see. But perhaps the biggest flaw in this study, and other studies like it, is that we have no idea what these women were really eating because, like most people when asked about their diet, they lied about it. How do we know this? Deduction. Consider: When the study began, the average participant weighed in at 170 pounds and claimed to be eating 1,800 calories a day. It would take an unusual metabolism to maintain that weight on so little food. And it would take an even freakier metabolism to drop only one or two pounds after getting down to a diet of 1,400 to 1,500 calories a day -- as the women on the ''low-fat'' regimen claimed to have done. Sorry, ladies, but I just don't buy it.	0
The committee would have discussed the question at its meeting this month, he said, but the meeting was canceled because of the terrorist attacks. Mr. Robertson added that he expected the committee to discuss the letter at its next meeting, in January. Mr. Robertson used the term ''gender variety'' to explain the acceptable uses of the sex selection technique. By that, he said, he meant that a couple who already had a child of one sex could ethically select embryos that would guarantee them that the embryo selected was of the opposite sex. Mr. Robertson wrote that embryo sex selection could be offered for gender variety ''when there is a good reason to think that the couple is fully informed of the risks of the procedure and are counseled about having unrealistic expectations about the behavior of children of the preferred gender.'' The group's previous statement, in 1999, said that selecting embryos solely to have a child of a particular sex ''should be discouraged.''	1
In programs often known as functional restoration, that is the goal. Patients are trained in strength, flexibility and endurance. They are counseled about their fears of re-injury and about anxiety and depression. It can be difficult to get them back to work, noted Dr. Bigos, of the University of Washington, because many left their jobs on disability and had bitter disputes with their former employers or with insurance companies. ''Usually, lines have been drawn in the sand by one or both sides,'' he said. But success is possible, said Dr. Thomas Mayer, director of a clinic called Pride, for Productive Rehabilitation Institute of Dallas for Ergonomics. Among the 3,500 back patients who entered his one- to two-month program and completed it, almost all returned to work and nearly half went back to their original employer, Dr. Mayer said. ''We deal with it face on,'' Dr. Mayer said. ''What are you going to do for the rest of your life? What are you getting from being disabled? What would you get if you were not disabled?''	1
The idea of a drug for one race has drawn the concern of several medical ethicists and scientists. Jonathan Kahn, a medical ethicist at Hamline University law school in St. Paul, said BiDil's approval as a black-only drug would give an official ring to the discredited idea that race is a biological category. ''It gives me great concern and pause to be going down this road, because we can't foresee all the bad consequences,'' said Dr. Kahn, who wrote an analysis of BiDil last year in The Yale Journal of Health Policy, Law and Ethics. Scientists know that different people have different responses to medications, and in some cases these have been linked to race. The F.D.A., for example, has said that people of Asian ancestry are more likely than others to get serious side effects from the cholesterol-lowering drug Crestor. But research shows that the underlying genetic variations across races are small.	0
''I have stiffness,'' she said. ''But the pain is gone.''	0
In addition to fish consumption, the environmental agency also looked at the risk from regular contact with river-bottom sediment -- for instance, wading barefoot -- over many years, and concluded that the chance of harm straddled the line between acceptable and unacceptable. It found that the risk from contact with the water alone, or the air near the river, was acceptable. General Electric contends that fish ingest PCB's from surface sediment on the river bottom, not from older, buried layers of sediment. As long as no new PCB's are being put in the river, it contends, the risk declines with each passing year. But today's report said that PCB's in the systems of largemouth bass, striped bass, otters, bald eagles and kingfishers, while dropping, still far exceed the levels that are safe to those animals.	0
Kolata knows this. She touches on reasons that poor people are more likely than rich people to be overweight, all of them environmental. But she treats childhood obesity as virtually inevitable. In addition to the twin and adoption studies, she cites research showing that teaching kids to eat right in school, and serving them leaner lunches, has no effect on their weights. The researchers concluded that the intervention was too limited -- the children's diets needed to change at home as well as at school. But Kolata scoffs at the ''popular solution,'' which is ''not to question the premise but rather to increase the intensity of the intervention.'' Given the rise in obesity, however, is it really credible to put all the blame on our genes -- and ignore the gazillion-dollar food industry? And while it's useful to point out that obese people don't have higher rates of anxiety, depression or mood disorders, that doesn't mean these conditions are never a factor in causing obesity in those who are genetically susceptible to it. As some of the testimony of Kolata's own dieters attests, we eat not just because our appetites drive us to but because our psyches do, in search of both pleasure and relief from pain or stress.	0
A decade ago, I stood alongside my 99 fellow freshmen as we were welcomed into the ranks of medicine in a ''white coat ceremony.'' Here, on our first day of med school, we were presented with the short white coats that proclaimed us part of the mystery and the discipline of medicine. During that ceremony, the dean said something that was repeated throughout my education: half of what we teach you here is wrong -- unfortunately, we don't know which half. At the time it was hard to believe. Within those walls, in the anatomy lab, in the lecture hall, you feel that you are being shown the secrets of how the body is put together, how it lives, how it works, how it dies. It has the feel of authority and certainty. Like math, it has a feeling of inevitability. But now, as a practicing doctor and teacher of residents, I relive that dean's aphorism daily. Medicine is, and always has been, an evolving discipline. And this necessarily means that what we know about medicine is constantly changing; that medicine is forever putting forth, and simultaneously upending, assumptions (as can be seen in the accompanying chart). This is particularly true at this moment. Virtually all of our medical therapeutic options are being questioned, evaluated and re-evaluated by researchers across the globe. Certainly in this century there will be new genes discovered and inventions developed, but medical progress right now centers on the rapid displacement of old ideas to make room for new knowledge. Medicine, always a fluid and dynamic science, is in the midst of a major growth spurt.	0
Dr. Freed said he was the first in the United States to offer the treatment, starting in 1988 with a 52-year-old man, who is still alive although, of course, he also still has Parkinson's disease. Dr. Freed continued to offer it to paying patients while he was treating those who were part of the federal study and whose procedures were paid for by the study. He said he considered these other operations research because he experimented with different amounts and placements of fetal cells. He has given fetal cell implants to 27 patients, he said, with the most recent operation last October. Dr. Freed said his group was now implanting less fetal tissue and putting the tissue in a different area of the brain, hoping to avoid the devastating side effects. But, he said it would be a mistake to stop doing the surgery altogether. ''To say that you can't do or shouldn't do human research because the research has uncertain outcome, I think would be a bad decision,'' Dr. Freed said.	1
That disappointment comes at a time when some experts have been questioning the value of screening tests for other cancers, including breast and ovarian cancers in women, prostate cancer in men, and lung cancer in both sexes. A key issue is whether the tests are finding a lot of tumors that would never become dangerous but cannot be distinguished from tumors that could become deadly, thereby causing many patients to undergo the risk of surgery, radiation or chemotherapy for no good reason. Each test has adherents who believe that early detection does far more good than harm, and critics who are not so sure. This debate underscores the importance of subjecting screening tests to rigorous trials to find whether they help reduce cancer mortality. Many tests have been adopted mostly on faith. But even clinical trials cannot resolve all questions. Mammography has been endorsed by the federal government on the basis of seven large clinical trials, but scientists argue over whether flaws in those studies invalidate the results or merely weaken them.	0
But Dr. Shine acknowledged that even the best-designed clinical trial can produce misleading data. '	0
WITH silicone breast implants back on the market, a debate over follow-up care is roiling the plastic surgery community, even as more women are choosing to have their breasts surgically enlarged. When the Food and Drug Administration decided last November to again allow the use of silicone for breast augmentation, it did so provided that manufacturers instruct doctors to advise patients they will need biannual M.R.I.'s to check for ruptures and should remove the implants if a rupture is detected. But some surgeons are criticizing the recommendations, saying they are bureaucratic and unscientific and that they interfere with their ability to tailor diagnosis and treatment to each patient. Some said they would not recommend the M.R.I.'s, while others said they would follow the recommendations, albeit unenthusiastically. ''The majority of plastic surgeons, even 99 percent of surgeons, would say there are problems with the directions,'' said Dr. Scott L. Spear, chairman of plastic surgery at Georgetown University Hospital. ''They bring a lot of red tape and expense.''	0
The middle-aged men and women begin arriving before 7 a.m., coming to a trailer in a church parking lot here for screenings that they say could save their lives. The tests are CT scans of the body -- high-speed, highly sensitive X-rays that can find tiny tumors, weak spots on blood vessels that make them bulge out like balloons, and calcified areas that may be indicative of heart disease. Body scans for healthy people were once the exclusive province of the rich, part of the gold-plated annual physical for executives. But with the endorsement of celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and a rush by radiologists, medical centers and entrepreneurs to offer them, the scans are available to the masses. As a result of competition, prices are dropping, from $1,000 or more to a few hundred dollars. New centers are springing up in cities and strip malls across the country. They advertise in newspapers, including The New York Times, on the radio, on billboards and in fliers sent by mail.	1
Dr. Cawkwell said Pfizer wanted to give the results first to investigators in the trial, which it did a couple of months ago. Then it was preparing a scientific publication to inform a broad range of doctors. But given current concern, she said, the company decided to release the data even before the scientific publication. Dr. Cawkwell said there was no urgency to announce the findings about Bextra when Vioxx was recalled because Pfizer thought that most patients switching off Vioxx would move to Celebrex. But the company is now seeing that a significant number of Vioxx users are moving to Bextra, which had sales of $545 million in the first half of this year, so it made the data public to help patients and physicians decide, she said. In trading yesterday, Pfizer's shares rose 50 cents, closing at $29. Merck was up 40 cents, to $30.90. Dr. Cawkwell said the Bextra results in coronary-bypass patients were not indicative of the risk for the broader population. ''The setting is so unique that it may or may not be applicable,'' she said.	0
The governing language is found in a decision in 2002 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Of the nine states in that circuit, seven have laws on medical marijuana. The court stated unambiguously that doctors had a First Amendment right to discuss with patients the possible benefits of marijuana for relief of pain, nausea and other symptoms suffered by people with ailments like cancer, H.I.V. and glaucoma. The court also clearly left open the possibility that doctors could be charged under federal drug statutes. ''If, in making the recommendation,'' the court wrote, ''the physician intends for the patient to use it as the means for obtaining marijuana, as a prescription is used as a means for a patient to obtain a controlled substance, then a physician would be guilty of aiding and abetting the violation of federal law.'' The ruling stemmed from a suit by California physicians and patients after the federal government had threatened legal action against doctors who recommended medical marijuana. The government issued the warnings in 1996, after voters had approved Proposition 215, the initiative that protected the right of patients to use marijuana for medical indications.	0
''I do see couples that are quite matter-of-fact about it, who feel like they have these wonderful kids and why not share them with the world,'' said Dr. Linda D. Applegarth, director of psychological services at the Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility at Weill Medical College of Cornell University. But those couples are not the norm, she said. In her program, about 50 couples in the last five years were interested in donating, yet all but a few have not completed required forms or psychological and medical screening. There has been a slight increase recently because of publicity, but only two sets of embryos are currently ready to be donated. Interestingly, those embryos belong to couples who used either a donated egg or sperm to create them, something that seems to make people more receptive to donating their embryos. ''These couples have already gone through the loss that comes with not having a 100 percent genetic connection to the embryos,'' Dr. Applegarth said. ''And someone donated to them.''	0
We know now that breast cancer is an extremely complex disease that often spreads invisibly through the body when a breast lump is small. Cancers detected while small may not, in fact, be early. The aggressiveness of a cancer, not just the time when it is discovered, helps determine a woman's fate. What is particularly disconcerting about the current debate over mammography is the inability of biostatisticians to agree on what the data show. Although the use of mammograms for women under 50 has been controversial for decades, the new study questions their value even after 50. The investigators in The Lancet gave weight to two studies, in Canada and in Malmo, Sweden, that are among the most skeptical about mammography. There are others with different results, and uncertainty will persist. What should women and their doctors do as we await more conclusive data? Here is my current strategy. For women under 50 -- those for whom doubts about mammography's value are strongest -- I will continue to encourage individual choice, sharing the data with patients and letting them choose whether to have mammography.  For women 50 to 70, I will continue to recommend yearly mammography. There has simply been too much supportive data for too long to abandon the test now. But I will also be less willing to insist on mammograms for my patients who decline them. At some point, we must be willing to challenge our most basic assumptions about how we fight breast cancer.	0
''At 57, it's a little late to be starting medical school,'' Mr. Schneider remarked acidly. ''But the burden still falls on me, having to pick among opinions.'' The job of being a modern patient includes not only decision making, of course, but often coordinating doctors, medical records and procedures, as well as negotiating with insurance companies, who are often the ultimate arbiters over which treatment options will be covered. As Ms. Gaines was being treated for cancer she had to wage such a battle. Before she had her diagnosis, her H.M.O. gynecologist laparoscopically removed what appeared to be a cyst on her ovary. But during the procedure, the cyst, which turned out to be a malignant tumor, burst, sending cancer cells into her abdomen. She then wanted to be treated by a specialist, but her insurance plan did not have a gynecological oncologist on its roster. So Ms. Gaines spent months fighting to transfer her care to an out-of-network doctor. Finally the insurers relented, but only after the specialist agreed to perform her surgery at the H.M.O.'s regional hospital, not his own.	???
Dr. Frederick Naftolin, chairman emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale and national co-principal investigator of the Keeps trial, said the findings of the Women's Health Initiative studies were counterintuitive. ''The relationship between the fall in estrogen and the rise in cardiovascular disease in women is incontrovertible,'' Dr. Naftolin said. ''So why in the world would you not try to find out whether simply maintaining estrogen at the levels of reproductive life could be cardioprotective?'' On the other side, researchers say the cardioprotective theory has been discredited. ''Atherosclerosis starts well before the age of menopause,'' said Dr. Deborah Grady, a principal investigator in the HERS trial. ''On top of that, why would you want a preventive intervention that has a lot of other side effects like blood clots? These people have a theory they don't want to give up on, no matter what.'' Dr. Richard M. Fuchs, a cardiologist and clinical professor of medicine at Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York, agreed.	0
In the long run, the best hope for resolving these issues lies in improving our understanding of cancer. Advances in genetic analysis may eventually allow scientists to distinguish between tumors that are potentially deadly and those that will remain harmless. Such advances would help clarify what doctors should do when they find tiny tumors on screening tests. Alternatively, someday treatments may become so good that it will not matter when a tumor is found; they will all be curable. But until that day, patients and their doctors will have to chart a course that feels comfortable to them. Some will choose screening and live with the uncertainty over whether any tumor found really needs treatment. Others will skip the screening and risk dealing with a dangerous tumor later, when its presence becomes inescapable. No expert has the answer to what is essentially a matter of individual choice. It is striking that the wife of a leading skeptic about mammography ignores her husband's doubts and gets an annual mammogram anyway, while the woman friend of a prominent believer in annual mammograms is screened only once every three years despite his urgings. Their loved ones may be experts, but it is the women who will have to live with the consequences of their decisions.	0
After the graduation ceremony, Dr. Sanford M. Simon, a professor of cellular biophysics, looked proudly at Yu Chen, a graduate who had worked in his lab, and described him and his classmates as the future of science.

Jeffery Taubenberger, the man most responsible for resurrecting the 1918 flu virus, was looking a little sick. His face was pale and his eyes red-rimmed, and he had barely touched the pasta he ordered for lunch. He pulled out a handkerchief and sneezed hard. ''There's not a respiratory virus on earth that I don't seem to want to amplify,'' he told me. ''If I were alive in 1918, I'd be dead.'' Taubenberger is the chairman of the department of molecular pathology of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Rockville, Md. His department was, in the early 90's, in the process of developing an expertise in retrieving tiny whispers of genetic code from putrefied flesh. As Gina Kolata described in her book ''Flu,'' Taubenberger decided in 1995 to look for the 1918 virus in samples of preserved lung in the A.F.I.P.'s tissue repository, which contains about three million pathological samples dating back to the Civil War. His techniques were far more advanced than anything Hultin had at his disposal, and his goal was more modest. Taubenberger knew that flu particles are too unstable to remain intact in a frozen corpse, and he wanted only to find a remnant of the virus's genetic code, perhaps enough to reveal what made it so virulent. But for a year and a half, he, too, failed. Finally, when Taubenberger was on the verge of giving up, he recovered from a soldier's lung a tiny fragment of the killer flu's identity, like the upturned edge of a sneering mouth.	0
Nutrients themselves had been around, as a concept, since the early 19th century, when the English doctor and chemist William Prout identified what came to be called the ''macronutrients'': protein, fat and carbohydrates. It was thought that that was pretty much all there was going on in food, until doctors noticed that an adequate supply of the big three did not necessarily keep people nourished. At the end of the 19th century, British doctors were puzzled by the fact that Chinese laborers in the Malay states were dying of a disease called beriberi, which didn't seem to afflict Tamils or native Malays. The mystery was solved when someone pointed out that the Chinese ate ''polished,'' or white, rice, while the others ate rice that hadn't been mechanically milled. A few years later, Casimir Funk, a Polish chemist, discovered the ''essential nutrient'' in rice husks that protected against beriberi and called it a ''vitamine,'' the first micronutrient. Vitamins brought a kind of glamour to the science of nutrition, and though certain sectors of the population began to eat by its expert lights, it really wasn't until late in the 20th century that nutrients managed to push food aside in the popular imagination of what it means to eat.	0

Having a colonoscopy is bad enough, but should you also have to worry that your doctor's skills are not up to snuff? That was Shavonne Reel's fear three years ago on the way to her first colonoscopy. Before the procedure, she noticed that her gastroenterologist seemed rushed and stingy with the details of the test, which can detect abnormal growths in the colon that can lead to cancer. Afterward, though he said he found nothing to worry about, he also said he could not reach a small part of her colon. The doctor put her on medication to ease her symptoms. This spring, when the rectal bleeding returned, Ms. Reel found another physician. During her second colonoscopy, her new doctor uncovered and removed a large growth. ''The second doctor found this huge polyp in the area the first one said he couldn't reach,'' said Ms. Reel, 26, an account associate at a Manhattan public relations firm. ''Something this large might have turned cancerous. I definitely think the doctor missed it the first time.''	0
Few dispute the need to move America's costly, fragmented health system from paper records and prescriptions into the computer age. Converting to digital records, health authorities agree, would reduce medical errors and improve efficiency, saving both lives and dollars. But what has been missing is a national road map that would encourage doctors, hospitals and insurers to invest in modern information technology. Yesterday, a group of 13 health and information technology organizations gave the Bush administration its recommendations for just such a road map for a national health information network. The group's report suggesting the principles that should guide the creation of such a network made an emphatic call for open, nonproprietary technical standards for communication across the network. The information on a patient inside a doctor's office, the report contends, must be capable of being sent across the network freely to hospitals, laboratories, specialists, insurers and researchers, if the promise of improved care and reduced costs are to be achieved.	0
Patients respond differently to statins, with some achieving more success in cholesterol reduction than others, Dr. Snow said. But, she said, ''our goal is not necessarily to get to a certain level of cholesterol, but to decrease heart attacks and strokes, and you can reduce that risk with a certain dose of statin.''	0
''They knew exactly what to do with it. They said, 'You want us to sell foods that are low fat or no fat? Sure, but you didn't say anything about calories!' And so the calories remained the same.'' Remember Snackwells, the popular cookie of the 1990's? It had no fat but plenty of refined carbohydrates: sweeteners in their various forms. The ''no fat'' label made many people think it was all right to eat an entire box. In one sitting. No fat, but the cookies still had plenty of calories. They just came from a different source. At the same time that people increased their consumption of carbohydrates, serving sizes were rising. Mindy Hermann, a registered dietician in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said: '' Everything is supersized. A single serving of a soft drink was once 6 ounces. Today it is 20 ounces. A bagel no longer weighs 2 ounces. It weighs 4 or 6. Hamburgers come in double and triple sizes, with two buns, twice as much cheese and a high-calorie sauce.''	0
Ray McAllister, a spokesman for CropLife America, a Washington group that represents pesticide manufacturers, said, ''We're pleased to see this larger, more comprehensive study confirming what other studies have said, and we hope it helps dispel concerns about health risks that might be posed by these compounds.'' He added that while some pesticides have caused cancer in laboratory animals, ''there has been no research that shows pesticides do cause cancer in humans.'' Advocates were quick to point out, however, that Dr. Gammon's findings did not prove to them that all pesticides were safe. ''To me it's still a no-brainer that you shouldn't use toxic chemicals on your lawn,'' said Karen Miller, the president of the Huntington Breast Cancer Action Coalition. ''They don't stop at weeds or rodents. They enter our bodies.'' She conceded that since other studies have also suggested that the pesticides in question may not be linked to breast cancer, it might be time to look elsewhere. ''All this means is we have to push for more funding to study all the other chemicals that could be causing breast cancer,'' she said.	0
One question that Congress would have to resolve in the beryllium compensation, and that would have to be addressed in any compensation plan developed as a result of the cancer finding, is whether to make payments to survivors. In the 57 years since the Manhattan Project began processing radioactive material to produce bombs, the government has until now minimized the hazards of radiation and chemicals, criticized epidemiological research that raised questions related to them and spent tens of millions of dollars in defending itself against lawsuits charging that the bomb plants had made workers sick. ''In the past, the role of government was to take a hike,'' Mr. Richardson said, ''and I think that was wrong.'' One expert on nuclear weapons manufacture, Robert Alvarez, a former Energy Department official,  welcomed the government's conclusion that many of its critics had been  correct. ''A review of the studies by a body impaneled by the president is official recognition,'' Mr. Alvarez said.  ''That's what makes this a big deal.''	0

For Yukie Kikuchi, 38, the city's sole practicing midwife, that has created worries. A year ago, during a snowstorm, one of Ms. Kikuchi's patients wondered whether she was going into labor and asked the midwife whether she should go to Morioka, a city more than an hour away. ''But there was a blizzard, you could hardly see, and I was torn whether she should go in this circumstance,'' said Ms. Kikuchi, who is not related to the city health official. Eventually, she advised her patient to stay put and was relieved to learn the next morning that it had been a case of false labor. Ms. Kikuchi said she was pleased and relieved now that obstetricians could remotely examine pregnant women here. Using the system, Ms. Kikuchi visits patients at their homes or receives them at a clinic in Tono to follow up on their pregnancies. During the examination, a machine hooked to the patient's stomach records the baby's heartbeat and sends the information over a cellular network to Ms. Kikuchi's cellphone and the cellphone of Dr. Toshihiro Ogasawara at Kamaishi Hospital.	0
Second, the aspirin group had almost twice the rate of strokes caused by bleeding into the brain as the others, although it was possible that the clustering of these devastating events in one group rather than the other was due to chance alone. Third, a similar British study could not replicate the American study's findings. The American study, although it is the biggest yet completed of aspirin use in healthy people and is considered a landmark in the field, also left unanswered the question of whether healthy middle-aged women might benefit from regular aspirin use. Most guidelines now suggest that regular low-dose aspirin may benefit middle-aged men if they have any other risk factors for heart disease, like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, or if they smoke cigarettes. But if a man has stomach problems, or any reasons for abnormal bleeding -- if he is a heavy drinker, for instance, or takes blood thinners -- then the risks of taking aspirin might outweigh the benefits.	0
''Everybody is just foaming at the mouth to make money'' from obesity drugs, said Dr. Donna Ryan, an obesity researcher affiliated with Louisiana State University, which has received millions of dollars in government and drug-industry grants. Industry forecasters say that an effective weight-loss drug could have annual sales far surpassing the current best-selling drug, the cholesterol treatment Lipitor, which reached $12 billion last year, especially now that Medicare says it will pay for ''effective'' obesity treatments. Some experts caution that the complex variables of culture, environment, genetics and lifestyle that contribute to obesity may defy a mass-market solution. ''One pill fits all doesn't seem like an outcome we'll be seeing on the horizon anytime soon,'' said Dr. Julie Gerberding, the physician who directs the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But most of the biggest drug makers feel financially compelled to stay in the hunt. As it becomes more and more difficult to identify blockbusters, many companies see few other prospective best sellers in their research pipelines.	???
Before the Olympic Games opened in Sydney last month, the aging gold medalists Bruce Jenner, Dorothy Hamill and Bart Conner were talking more about their arthritis than the coming events. There's a good reason. All three athletes are being paid by either Merck or Pharmacia to appear on talk shows and speak to groups about the new prescription pain relievers that they are taking for their sore joints. The testimonials are part of one of the fiercest and most expensive battles now being waged in the pharmaceutical business: the war between Merck's Vioxx and Pharmacia's Celebrex. Since last year, Merck and Pharmacia, which has hired the drug giant Pfizer to help sell its new drug, have each been spending tens of millions of dollars a month on marketing their new blockbuster pain relievers to patients and doctors. The money is paying for television and print advertisements, for stipends to hundreds of doctors to speak on behalf of the drugs and for millions of free samples of the medications, known as Cox-2 inhibitors. Each side now has more than 4,000 representatives visiting doctors to promote the drugs.	0
''It's hard, oh it's very hard, to get changes,'' Dr. Epstein said. Even when obese children lost weight, they were often still overweight, he said. But, he said, ''if a child starts out at 80 percent overweight and ends up at 50 percent overweight, that kid is probably better off.'' Dr. Epstein said he taught parents how to set food limits, how to make good food choices and keep fattening foods out of the house and how to keep their children away from the television set. ''We taught parents how to get control of their sedentary lives, to change the environment so there is less access to TV and computer games,'' he said. ''The biggest part of our program isn't what sort of diet you should be on or what sort of exercise program you should be on. It's parenting.'' But, for now, no one can claim to have a good and reproducible method for preventing obesity in children or for curing it. Treatment programs are expensive and, especially since there is no evidence that they work, they are seldom paid for by health insurance. That leaves parents and pediatricians in a quandary over whether to treat a fat child or leave the child alone.	1
The fertility business is unlike any other in medicine, doctors and laboratory directors say. For one thing, it is regulated: it is the only medical specialty that requires clinics to report success rates to the federal government. But at the same time, it can be as competitive and commercial as laser eye surgery or plastic surgery. Since most patients pay with their own money, in cash, and cash-paying patients can pretty much pick and choose where they go, fertility specialists say that if they want to survive, they have to get the attention of both patients and referring doctors. Fertility centers often use some of the same strategies as large drug companies, with dinners, seminars and gifts for referring doctors, and marketing representatives who show up regularly at the referring doctors' doors. To attract patients, many provide special financing schemes, including money-back guarantees. But fertility experts say that no matter how skilled they are, no matter how honest they are about what they can offer, marketing is a fact of life.	1

''Cancer cells opportunistically resort to turning on these programs, and in so doing, acquire all the traits that permit them to disseminate through the body,'' Dr. Weinberg said. ''What remains unclear is whether or not all malignant carcinoma cells must undergo an E.M.T. in order to invade and metastasize.'' Dr. Welch of Alabama added, ''The problem is experimentally proving there is a turning on of E.M.T. and then a turning off of E.M.T. when the cell lands at the distant site.'' Others are looking at cancer stem cells. Adult stem cells have the ability to renew themselves and generate new cells, but they can also become cancerous. Some experts believe that cancer stem cells are at the core of every metastasis. This would help explain why millions of cells can reach distant organs, but only a select few -- presumably those with stem cell capacities -- can initiate a tumor and colonize.	0
In the simplest terms, the method involves sending, photon by photon, a message that can serve as a mathematical key after it is decoded. Such a key can then be used to encode and decode E-mail messages. In other words, the new encryption system is not for the poor or the technologically faint-hearted. The technique is called quantum cryptography. It got its start in 1989 when a team of I.B.M. researchers, led by Charles Bennett, announced that it had succeeded in building a contraption that transmitted a secure message a few feet by flashing a laser on and off. Dr. Bennett said the system was based on exploiting certain aspects of quantum physics that govern the realm of the very small. A quantum system, he said, ''has properties that can't be measured without disturbing other properties.'' What happens is that the act of observing affects the photons. So if a spy or eavesdropper interrupted the message, or even decoded it, that action would destroy the message itself.	0
Lillie Shockney  Breast cancer survivor, registered nurse, Johns Hopkins Breast Center, Baltimore I'm a huge fan of mammography. My cancer was found accidentally on a mammogram. It was 10 years ago. I was 38, and I had a baseline mammogram. I had found a lump on my right breast, which ended up being a cyst. But they found an invasive tumor in my left breast. It was just four millimeters, very tiny, and would only have been found on a mammogram. If I had waited until I was 40 to have my baseline, I probably would not be talking with you right now. I had no family history, no known risk factors, like smoking or early menstruation or having a first child after age 30. Seventy percent of women with breast cancer have no known risk factors. Mammography is still at this moment in time our best weapon for early detection. I cannot imagine a woman not pursuing it.	0
How feasible is it to do this testing widely? BUTLER: It's expensive, and I don't think it's a good idea for the public at large because we don't have a treatment. But for research, it's fantastic because the earlier that we can make the identification, the more we can introduce potential interventions, like drugs being developed that would prevent or dissolve the accumulation of amyloid. GUARENTE: I would just point out that Alzheimer's would be in the group of diseases that has aging as an underlying risk factor, so being able to manipulate the aging process, I think, would also have implications for Alzheimer's. BUTLER: For me, one of the most disturbing experiences is putting a fully incapacitated Alzheimer's patient in front of a mirror and asking him who he is, and he doesn't know. It's just shocking to see that happen to human beings -- they don't even recognize themselves. Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Prize winner who wrote ''Night,'' said we are our memories. Which I think is a beautiful statement of the significance of memory, because when you're older, you also tend to review your life and to try to come to terms with it, and if you have Alzheimer's, you're denied that opportunity.	0
Some doctors have been prescribing antidepressants instead of hormones, while many women are trying herbal products like black cohosh or are increasing their consumption of soy. So far, scientific proof that alternative treatments work has been limited and mixed, with questions over proper dosages, inconsistent quality and long-term safety. Still other women are trying new, low-dose versions of Prempro and Premarin or so-called bioidentical hormones -- compounds made with at least some natural products in small, boutique labs. Dr. Manson, the Women's Health Initiative researcher, and other experts said drugmakers were aggressively marketing the new forms of hormones, including low dose pills, patches and creams. Dr. Randall S. Stafford, an assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford Intervention Research Center, whose research includes tracking promotional patterns for hormone therapy, said he saw an increase in consumer ads, ads in medical journals, free samples to doctors and visits to doctors' offices by drug company representatives -- especially for low-dose Prempro and Premarin, introduced this year.	0
''I tell patients if the reconstruction is going to be radiated, it will definitely change the appearance of their cosmetic outcome,'' Dr. Topham said. ''The degree to which it changes is unpredictable. It may be very mild or very severe.'' Because the change can be mild, some plastic surgeons believe that delaying reconstruction is not necessary. A few studies show low rates of complications with immediate reconstruction, but they represent a minority. Research suggests that women fare better emotionally if reconstruction is performed at the time of the mastectomy, so the trend toward delayed reconstruction is viewed with some alarm. ''People took a long time to get away from delayed reconstruction, and now we're going back to it, which seems to be a big step backward,'' said Dr. Abram Recht, deputy chief of radiation oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. If reconstruction is delayed, using an implant is out of the question for most women, Dr. Spear said.	0

One mother in Short Hills, N.J., questioned her pediatrician when her 5-year-old daughter developed oily hair and body odor. But the mother said that the doctor kept saying there was nothing to worry about. Two years later, Dr. Maria I. New, chairman of the pediatrics department at Cornell University's Weill Medical College, found that the child had a genetic disorder, nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which, left untreated, stops bone growth and can cause acne, baldness and infertility. ''She lost approximately four inches of adult height,'' the mother said. In 1999, the debate was inflamed by an article in Pediatrics, by Dr. Kaplowitz and Dr. Sharon E. Oberfield, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and approved by a committee of the pediatric endocrine society. Based on Dr. Herman-Giddens's data, they said, the guidelines for assessing puberty should be changed. Now, they said, with few exceptions, the only girls who need to be evaluated for early puberty are black girls under age 6 and white girls under age 7 who are developing breasts or pubic hair.	1
Your dental health may be a sign not only of how diligently you brush and floss but also of your risk of stroke and heart disease. A number of studies have indicated a relationship between periodontal disease and a heightened risk of developing problems with the heart or circulatory system. But pinning down those suspicions has proved difficult. Now a new study has provided what several experts called the most solid evidence yet. The study found that older adults who had lost 10 to 19 teeth were more likely than those who had lost fewer teeth to have a major risk factor for stroke -- plaque clogging the main arteries to the brain. A leading theory for the connection between the teeth and the arteries is that periodontal disease, a bacterial infection of the gums, may start a cascade of chemical events that cause inflammation throughout the body. Chronic inflammation in the arteries is thought to contribute to atherosclerosis, a narrowing of blood vessels that can lead to stroke or heart attack.	0
And the outlook for them is improving -- people are getting the diseases later in life, and death rates are falling. Yet, in many instances, patients are undertreated or treated inappropriately. In some cases, science has not offered answers, but in others, the medical system has been unable to turn proven remedies into everyday care. Today, The New York Times examines the No. 1 killer, heart disease. A million Americans have heart attacks each year and half a million die. A great deal is known about how to prevent heart attacks, how to save lives and prevent disability. But opportunities are squandered out of complacency, denial and because of the way heart care is paid for. Among the current findings: Only a small fraction of the nation's acute care hospitals offer a treatment, angioplasty, that can open blocked arteries. Yet many other hospitals are reluctant to divert patients there because heart attack patients are so lucrative.	0
It's time to move beyond the debates about the utility of breast self-examination and mammography and increase the resources and energy devoted to finding something that will truly give us early detection.

IT means that I must eat premade, prepacked, premeasured hospital food (and not a morsel of anything else) for the three days before each overnight stay. Worst of all, it means that I must greet two mornings each year without caffeine. Technically, I knew all this when I volunteered. The hospital sent me all sorts of information, which I have no recollection of reading, although I signed the consent forms. At any rate, the reality of those tests is different from the clinical descriptions. I'm still not sure how I got involved. Years ago, while researching a magazine article, I participated for a day in a metabolic study conducted at the hospital, which is known for its metabolic research. Last year, my name apparently surfaced. Someone must have done the math and realized that I was just about the age (48) to be a candidate for a ''menopause transition'' project. I got a call and, without thinking much about it, said, ''Why not?''	0
Yet doctors like Dr. Eric Braverman, director of PATH Medical, a center for integrative medicine in New York, defend the use of HGH at low, carefully supervised levels. One of his patients, an 82-year-old retired executive from Long Island, who requested anonymity for privacy reasons, said that daily HGH injections over the last 13 months had repaired some of the damage he incurred from congestive heart failure and overmedication for high-blood pressure. ''I can't walk fast, but I can walk 40 blocks now with no trouble,'' he said. ''I've had virtually no side-effects.'' Dr. Braverman predicts that HGH will become more widely prescribed. ''I am convinced that it is a core dimension in dealing with the effects of aging,'' he said. ''I have hundreds of patients with experience, and it's rare that they have side-effects. The real danger is that these things are being sold over the Internet.'' On that issue, both sides agree.	0
One of the central tenets of modern medicine is that the earlier your doctor can catch a disease, the better. This has proved a brilliant strategy for several conditions. Detecting high blood pressure, for example, and treating it can cut a patient's risk of stroke by a third and the chances of heart disease by 20 percent. Identifying patients with the first signs of diabetes and controlling their blood sugar can help significantly reduce the chances of cardiovascular disease, kidney and neurological damage and blindness. By spotting an abdominal aneurysm, doctors can monitor the progress of the defect and repair it before it ruptures. The notion that disease could be prevented at all was shaped by the sanitary movement of the 19th century, when doctors and antipoverty activists set about improving the living conditions of the poor and reduced the appalling rates of infectious disease. Today, the simplest and most effective prevention medicine stops disease before it starts through vaccinations, for instance, or encouraging people to exercise more, smoke less, eat fruits and vegetables and drink in moderation -- all of which can cut the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke.	0
As legal cases have become increasingly technical, said Peter H. Schuck, a Yale law professor, the different legal and scientific approaches have clashed more openly than ever before. ''Science is always gaining new information,'' Professor Schuck said. ''The law is the opposite. It has to make a decision so people can get on with their lives.'' The legal system long ago recognized that legal and scientific determinations might contradict each other, he said. For decades, for example, individual smokers have had difficulty winning damage suits against tobacco companies despite the overwhelming scientific consensus that tobacco is linked to disease. Some scholars say the inconsistencies are a small price to pay for a legal system that does not have the luxury of waiting for scientific certainty. ''People just have to get used to the idea that the legal system is imperfect,'' said Saul Levmore, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.	0
In 2001, Mr. Principi extended benefits to veterans of the Persian Gulf war who suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, after studies found them to be nearly twice as likely to contract the disease as other troops. ''We have come to learn that environmental hazards of the battlefield can prove to be as disabling or deadly as the more traditional form of combat,'' he said in an interview. Until now, the relationship between Agent Orange and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, has been murky. Although the disease is the most common form of leukemia, it is still considered a rare form of cancer. About 7,000 cases were diagnosed last year in the United States, presenting researchers with a small sample from which to draw conclusions. The panel at the Institute of Medicine, which Congress finances as part of the National Academy of Sciences, took a different tack when researchers noted that lymphocytic leukemia, although classified as leukemia, shared many traits with Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, both of which had been linked to herbicide exposure.	0
The study was led by Dr. Barry Reisberg of the New York University School of Medicine. He said he had urged Merz Pharmaceuticals, a German company that owns the rights to the drug, to study the effects of memantine in patients with more advanced cases of the disease. The company, Dr. Reisberg said, hesitated at first, saying it had limited money. ''They kept saying, 'We're Merz, not Merck,' '' he recalled, but eventually Merz supported a study involving 252 patients who took memantine or a placebo for 28 weeks. The disease progressed at a slightly slower rate in those taking the drug, researchers concluded. Still, Alzheimer experts in the United States remain cautious. ''It's going to be useful because it's a different drug, it has a different mechanism of action'' than the three drugs on the market for mild to moderate disease, Dr. Petersen said. ''I don't think it's a home run. I think its effects are pretty modest.''	1
In Southern California, two entrepreneurs (and Atkins dieters) last month opened the first two in a chain of low-carb supermarkets called Pure Foods, and individual low-carb markets are opening nationwide. In January, a new magazine called LowCarb Living hit newsstands. The boom in low-fat products in the 1980's and 90's reflected the F.D.A.'s recommendations as well as years of studies showing that low-fat diets could reduce the risks of heart diseases and various cancers. But the surge in low-carb products primarily reflects the runaway success of books about the low-carb diets, which are being used by an estimated 10 million to 25 million people. Doctors have warned that high levels of saturated fats in some low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets can lead to heart disease and kidney problems. And critics worry that just as some people took low-fat as a license to eat the whole carton of light ice cream, they will take low-carb as permission to eat the entire crustless cheesecake, fattening up on calories either way.	0
The Food and Drug Administration warned the company in 1995 not to manipulate data to show positive results. Last year, university scientists charged the company with trying to squelch publication of their scientific paper describing a clinical trial that failed. The company said it wanted the paper to include a chart that suggested Remune had some effectiveness, but the lead authors of the paper said the chart was based on spurious analysis. That trial, on more than 2,500 patients, failed to show that Remune improved survival or lengthened the time before H.I.V. infection progressed to AIDS. But the trial took place just as new AIDS drugs were coming into use that vastly improved survival of patients. That, the company argued, made it nearly impossible for Remune to show a benefit over the placebo. So newer trials looked to see whether Remune can suppress levels of the virus in the blood. But the company announced on June 1 that a trial in Spain found Remune no better than the placebo. The company argues that the vaccine worked in a subset of patients with stronger immune systems, and it will present data on this in Argentina. Some doctors testing Remune say further trials are warranted but, with Pfizer's pullback, might not happen.	0
The Women's Health Initiative was not the first large trial to report negative results about hormones and heart disease. The Heart and Estrogen-Progestin Replacement Study or HERS, had looked at whether combination hormone therapy would prevent a second heart attack and found that the risk actually increased in the first year of use. Smaller clinical trials are under way to explore the ''window of opportunity'' theory, but they lack the health initiative's power of numbers, and they will track markers for heart disease, not heart attacks. ''What we're trying to do is reconcile why there is such a disconnect, or paradox, between the observational trials and the randomized controlled trials,''said Dr. Isaac Schiff, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and chairman of a report on hormone therapy for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Simplified, the window of opportunity argument goes something like this: Most women do not develop heart disease until after menopause, because estrogen protects their blood vessels, keeping them smooth and free of plaque. But if women go without estrogen for a long period after menopause, they will develop atherosclerosis. At that point, estrogen may be harmful, because it increases the tendency to clot, raising the risk of a heart attack.	0
Facing a staggering financial crisis that is forcing it to make deep cuts in its services, Mount Sinai Medical Center announced yesterday that the president of its hospital, Barry R. Freedman, was being replaced. Mr. Freedman, who has been associated with the hospital for 25 years, many of those in top leadership positions, will be succeeded by Dr. Larry Hollier, now a senior vice president and the hospital's chief of surgery. It was a decision that Mount Sinai's trustees described as an attempt to begin remaking the hospital into more of a ''physician-led organization.'' During Mr. Freedman's tenure, the hospital began an ambitious building program, increased admissions and managed for a while to cut its average length of stay, increasing revenues. But as the landscape of health care financing began to shift during the 1990's, and after the medical center entered into what became a troubled merger with New York University Medical Center in 1998, the hospital's fortunes began to decline.	0
There's no way, of course, to put a dollar figure on some effects of global warming, like the loss of species or the pain people feel on being dislocated. Most Americans would probably prefer not to see any change in the climate, and Dr. Mendelsohn is sympathetic to their view. ''If it were cheap to do, I'd keep the climate constant,'' he said. ''But it's not cheap. For every dollar we spend on mitigation, at most we would get 10 cents back, and it could only be 1 cent. To me, it looks like a very bad investment. I'd rather spend the money on programs today to cut  pollution, improve public health and establish zones for protecting biodiversity. We'd get larger benefits, and we wouldn't have to wait 100 years for them.'' In other work, Dr. Mendelsohn has found that the worldwide economic costs and benefits of climate change would roughly balance out. Again, most of the benefits would be in the North, while farmers in the tropics would suffer.	0
Breast augmentation surgery can cost from $4,500 to $10,000, including silicone implants -- which are more expensive -- or saline implants, surgeons' fees and operating-room costs. Health insurance does not typically cover cosmetic procedures. But even as more women choose breast augmentation, surgeons have been engaged in a heated debate over how best to monitor and treat silicone patients. Doctors must go over a checklist about risks and follow-up care with every patient seeking silicone implants, according to manufacturers' guidelines. And in advising them to get an M.R.I. every two years starting the third year after the surgery, doctors said they also inform patients of an additional cost of $1,000 to $2,200, which is unlikely to be covered by insurance. The tests deter some patients. ''If you added up all the M.R.I.'s you would need over the years, I figured the cost of the tests would soon outstrip what you paid for the actual augmentation with silicone,'' said Michelle C. Meyer, a bank teller in Waseca, Minn., who got saline implants last week.	0
J. Carol Goodman, a 71-year-old writer from Morristown, N.J., was hiking in the Swiss Alps four years ago when she became dizzy, lost her sense of balance and began, as she put it, walking like a drunk. She managed to get back to her friends' home in St. Moritz and went to bed. ''I woke the next morning with the room spinning,'' she recalled. After she began vomiting, she was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital. ''By the time I got there, the doctors said my eyes were jiggling out of my head,'' she said. ''I was on the fastest roller coaster in the world and could not stop it.'' The Swiss doctors stabilized nerve spasms in and around her eyes and she flew home to New Jersey the next day. Mrs. Goodman says her collapse was the culmination of health problems she had steadily developed since 1992, when she was bitten by a tick in her backyard and Lyme disease was diagnosed.	0
But wait a minute. Don't those compelling five-year survival statistics of 80 percent vs. 15 percent prove that CT screening works? The short answer is no. You have to consider exactly how a five-year survival rate is figured. It is a fraction. Imagine 1,000 people diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago. If 150 are alive today, the five year survival is 150/1000, or 15 percent. Yet even if CT screening raised the five-year survival rate to 80 percent, it is entirely possible that no one gets an extra day of life. The best way to understand this paradox is to work through a thought experiment. First, consider a group of people with lung cancer who will all die at age 70. If they first receive the diagnosis when they are 67, their five-year survival rate would be zero percent. But if these same people had received their diagnoses earlier -- at, say, age 63 -- the five-year survival rate would be 100 percent. Yet death would still come at 70 for all of them. Earlier diagnosis always increases the five-year survival statistic, but it doesn't necessarily mean that death is postponed.	0
The slaughter of more than 100 million chickens this spring seemed to bring the disease under control. But it has reappeared this summer, killing the three people who are confirmed to have caught it in recent days in Vietnam. Hong Kong and Chinese officials announced separately on Friday that China had temporarily suspended shipments of chilled ducks and geese to Hong Kong from neighboring Guangdong Province earlier this month. The Hong Kong government said this was to check whether ducks and geese there had avian influenza; China has not acknowledged any such cases. Most kinds of influenza viruses live only in birds, not people. But pigs can be infected with both bird strains and human strains of influenza. When these viruses mix and reassort genes inside a pig, the result can be a new virus for which people have little immunity. Many scientists believe that the great flu pandemics of the 20th century -- the Spanish influenza of 1918-19, the Asian flu of 1957-58 and the Hong Kong flu of 1968-69 -- began when new flu strains moved from birds to people. Estimates of worldwide deaths from the Spanish influenza range from 20 million to 100 million, while the next two pandemics together killed 4 million to 5 million people.	???
But even if Kirsch's case proves too extreme, that still leaves a placebo response rate of between 30 to 40 percent, meaning that 30 to 40 percent of the depressed subjects in clinical trials feel happier while taking a contentless pill. And there is good reason to think that that may be an underestimate. In the first place, many randomized controlled trials are preceded by a so-called washout phase in which all participants take an inert pill and anyone who reacts favorably to it is eliminated; the 30 to 40 percent comes out of a group, then, that has already been purged of probable placebo-reactors. In the second place, several studies show that the rate may be more like 50 percent for depressions that have lasted less than three months, especially if they were also triggered by a specific event. Given that active drugs often have unwelcome side effects (though, oddly, placebo takers sometimes report these, too) and that many patients might be relieved to know they don't actually need a chemical antidote to their woes, why shouldn't doctors give Brown's suggestion a try?	0
Of course, the general practitioner had neither: he was just a doc with four years of medical school plus a yearlong internship under his belt when he started practicing. He had gotten most of his training on the job. How could he compete with these new specialists? Graduating doctors flocked to hospital-based training programs to enter the rarefied air of specialty medicine. In 1940, three-quarters of doctors were generalists. Three decades later, only 20 percent were. Around that time, though, it became clear that in trading up from the general practitioner to the specialist, some things had been lost. In 1961, The New England Journal of Medicine published a paper that used the new science of epidemiology to show that specialists, with all their fancy training, were actually rather poorly prepared for the patients they saw once they went into practice. These doctors learned medicine by treating the sickest patients, yet many ended up caring for a relatively healthy population. Most of their patients were far too well to be in the hospital and wanted their doctors to help them stay that way. Hospital-based training left these doctors singularly unprepared for that task. As a result, specialty doctors, like the old G.P.'s, got the training they really needed on the job.	0
The catch is that the new pump will cost $2,000, about 10 times more than conventional pumps. ''Yes, it would be more expensive,'' Mr. Vincent said. ''But if we're right it would save a lot of money.'' The best way to improve health care and contain costs is to take a new approach, said Dr. Dean Ornish, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and a leading proponent of preventive medicine. Medicine is currently practiced, he said, as part of a ''disease care system'' geared to reactingto the consequences of bad health instead of treating the underlying causes. More than 90 percent of heart disease, Dr. Ornish insists, is preventable. Over the years, Dr. Ornish has led several projects showing that fundamental changes in diet, exercise and stress management can stop and even reverse heart disease. Preventive programs cost money upfront, but can cut overall treatment costs to insurers by 30 percent or more, yet few insurers pay for preventive care.	???
AS a New York Knick, Fred Crawford suited up with Bill Bradley and Willis Reed. Later he was a member of the Los Angeles Lakers when Elgin Baylor and Jerry West were the stars of that team. He ended his career with the Milwaukee Bucks, whose center was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. That was three decades ago. Late last month, as he entered a medical office on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Mr. Crawford moved in what must have seemed like slow motion to him. Decades of constant pounding had taken their toll on his left hip. Pain and weakness prevented him from walking more than three blocks at a time. ''Basketball is a tough business, but you're not thinking about that at the time,'' Mr. Crawford said. His diagnosis: moderately severe osteoarthritis. Mr. Crawford is not alone. About  21 million Americans are afflicted with osteoarthritis. (According to a federal study, the figure will soar to more than 30 million by 2020, as the baby boomers grow older.) Women stand a greater chance than men of developing the disease, especially women over 65. But some arthritis experts are noticing a change in their patients: more men developing severe cases, and earlier, in their 50's rather than in their 60's and 70's, which may be attributed to more participation in strenuous sports.	0
It is painless. I know that now. A cocktail of sedatives takes the edge off the discomfort, which is more in our heads than in our rumps anyway. There are no pain receptors in the colon, and you can watch the event progress on a television monitor at no extra charge. The pictures seemed almost impressionist, very color intensive to me. Maybe it was the drugs. Only slight abdominal pressure registered, but the truth is, our phobias are all about the instant of entry, the long anticipated, awful anal invasion that makes grown men cringe. Face it. Guys are wimps. Women are used to routine medical invasion. Alas, it is their lot in life. By the time a woman hits 50 and heads for the doctor, earlier if there is a family history, she has been probed and prodded in every orifice. Women who have borne children should laugh at such male distress. When Colonoscopy Claus comes down the chimney, women may not jingle bells, but they seem to sigh and embrace him.	0
''There are more Americans for sure as time goes on,'' said Rabbi Yonatan Adler, the director of Puah's public relations. One reason is religious, the other is cost. Older women are more likely to be accepted, too. Rabbi Gideon Weitzman, who heads the institute's English-speaking section, said, ''People are exploring the possibilities.'' Like Ms. Abbey. She recalled methodically pricing Thailand at $3,000 but deciding that the medicine was too primitive, ruling out London at $7,000 a cycle, and dismissing Germany for low success rates. But everything was better than the upwards of $18,000 for a doctor and treatment that she was quoted when they lived in Modesto, Calif. The total cost for her two in vitro efforts in Naples was less than $8,500, she said. ''People will do anything for a baby,'' Ms. Abbey said. ''There're women out there who've hocked the house. So what's the big deal about taking your passport and leaving the country?''	0
Even so, it is sobering to find that the virus has been getting ever more lethal, and that it is now so deeply entrenched in wild and domestic bird populations that it may be impossible to eradicate. Chinese researchers reported last month that virus samples taken from domestic ducks in China were causing increasingly severe disease when administered to mice, which are often used as a surrogate to determine what might happen in humans. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization reported last month that avian influenza appeared to have re-emerged in poultry in several Asian countries, including China, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. The widespread culling efforts early this year, in which more than 100 million birds were destroyed in an effort to halt the spread of the disease, obviously fell short of the goal. Two United Nations bodies -- the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization -- have stepped up their efforts to combat the epidemic in birds before the virus can leap to humans.	0
Cardiologists, radiologists and others could buy their own CT scanners, though, so all the payments could go to them. The customary amount that insurers will eventually pay for CT scans is not yet known, but ''obviously, there's a potential for being financially remunerated at a high level,'' Dr. Topol said. Radiologists also say they could do the CT scans, assuming much of the business of cardiologists, who had angiography all to themselves. ''Cardiologists made a lot of money with stress tests and coronary catheterization,'' said Dr. David Dowe, a radiologist who is medical director and chief operating officer of Atlantic Medical Imaging in Galloway, N.J. ''Now radiologists are capable of doing this test without a cardiologist's involvement.'' Some who have had CT heart scans are delighted. At Beaumont Hospital, which has a new Siemens scanner, Dr. O'Neill had a scan himself. He has also had an angiogram. With a strong history of heart disease in his family, he wanted to check his arteries, even though he had no symptoms.	1
But the cell populations to be implanted must be pure, said Dr. Goldman of Rochester, who is also a professor of neurology. It is essential, he said, that the cells contain no residual embryonic stem cells, because when implanted in the body they tend to form tumors called teratomas that consist of a mix of tissue types including hair, skin and teeth. Moreover, Dr. Goldman said, for certain applications, like treating neurologic diseases, implanting the wrong type of nerve cell could cause side effects like seizures. But the work is advancing. ''With adequate funding, there's no question we could be in clinical trials in two or three years,'' said Robert P. Lanza, medical director of Advanced Cell Technology Inc., a Worcester, Mass., company that has been pursuing therapeutic cloning but now has only a handful of scientists. ''The question is are we going to be around to be doing this work.''	0
Federal health officials yesterday sharply reduced the desired levels of harmful cholesterol for Americans who are at moderate to high risk for heart disease. The new recommendations call for treatment with cholesterol-lowering drugs for millions of Americans who had thought their cholesterol levels were fine. Already more than 10 million people take the drugs. But now, more should start, the recommendations say. For people at the highest risk, they suggest that the target level of L.D.L., the type of cholesterol that increases the likelihood of heart disease, should be less than 100. That is 30 points lower than previously recommended. For people at moderately high risk, lowering L.D.L. to below 100 with medication should be seriously considered, the report said. The advice for people at low risk remains unchanged. The recommendations were published today in the journal Circulation and endorsed by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; the American Heart Association; and the American College of Cardiology. The authors said the change was prompted by data from five recent clinical trials indicating that the current cholesterol goals were not aggressive enough and that more intense drug treatment led to better results.	1
Ms. Gallagher still regularly returns to L-Marc to check her weight on the clinic's scale. She says she has lost an additional five pounds since completing the trial. ''I guess I've changed my way of eating, too,'' said Ms. Gallagher, who now takes fruit with her to work, where she no longer fears catching a glimpse of herself. Another L-Marc clinical trial participant, John Froman, 50, said he used to spend holidays eating his way from one family dinner to another, putting on weight at each stop. ''You do two Christmases, three Thanksgivings, two New Years; everybody is cooking real big,'' said Mr. Froman, who maintains locks on the Ohio River for the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Mr. Froman lost 60 pounds and he credits the little white pill he took. But he says the advice he was given has changed his outlook on life, and he will no longer stuff himself.	???
Researchers have known for years the conditions that predispose a person to stroke -- smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol and an irregular heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation. But the major one is high blood pressure. ''Of all the modifiable risk factors, high blood pressure leads the list,'' Dr. Sacco said. ''With heart disease, you think more of cholesterol; with stroke you think of high blood pressure.'' The reason, Dr. Sacco said, is that with high blood pressure, the tiny blood vessels in the brain clamp down so much and so hard to protect the brain that they can become rigid. Then they get blocked. The result is a stroke. Often, people decide they do not need their blood pressure medication or simply forget to take it because they feel well. But, Dr. Sacco said, patients are not solely to blame. Doctors may not have time to work with patients, monitoring blood pressure, telling them about changes in their diet and exercise that might help, or trying different drugs and combining them if necessary.	1
GERI BARISH, like so many other breast cancer survivors on Long Island, had waited for years for the results of a federal study on what connection, if any, pesticides and air pollution might have on breast cancer on Long Island. So it was no surprise that she was disappointed when the findings of the National Cancer Institute study were released last week and showed that four chemicals long suspected as potential causes of breast cancer are, in fact, probably not responsible for the Island's cancer rate, which is higher than the state and national rates. The rate in Nassau County is 115.6 cases per 100,000 women and in Suffolk County, the rate is 118.2. The state's rate is 104.1 cases per 100,000 women, and nationally, it is 109.5. For New York City, the rate is 97.2. ''Disappointed but not discouraged,'' Ms. Barish said. ''We thought this would give us all the answers, but the thing about science is it just raises more questions.''	0
The Food and Drug Administration, whose approval is required for gene therapy trials, agreed. ''There are a number of scientific questions and safety issues to be addressed before any of that could go forward,'' Dr. Philip Noguchi, the director of the agency's division of cellular and gene therapies, said in an interview. ''We don't quite know what we should be concerned about because the biological understanding has not been developed yet.'' The National Institutes of Health held a meeting of experts last March to explore the use of H.I.V. vectors for gene therapy, which involves inserting genes for a particular function into a patient's cells. But Dr. Noguchi said a wider, more open public hearing would be held before his agency would consider approving the first such trial. ''The public hasn't really weighed in with its own opinion,'' he said. It is the very infectiousness of H.I.V. that makes it attractive for gene therapy, which so far has not lived up to its expectations. People with hemophilia, for instance, have an inherited genetic defect that prevents them from making a crucial protein needed for blood clotting. But if enough of the patient's cells could be provided with the proper gene, the patient could manufacture his own blood clotting factor.	???
In theory, he says, they could shield the respiratory system from oxidative damage from pollution and cigarettes, which send ''literally trillions of free radicals down into the lungs.'' Now, he says, he urges patients to get their antioxidants in diets rich in fruits and vegetables. BOOKS ON HEALTH	0
The success, at last, of gene therapy shows the wisdom of such an approach, experts said. ''They did all the science beforehand and then translated it to the patient, which is what I think the field should be doing,'' Dr. Orkin said. Dr. Anderson said that while other forms of SCID should be amenable to gene therapy now, nonetheless, ''because you correct SCID doesn't mean you can correct any other disease.'' But he added, ''If you can't correct SCID, you can't correct anything else.''	1
The Norvasc study also had somewhat paradoxical results. The study, which followed almost 20,000 patients with high blood pressure from 1998 until 2004, showed that patients taking Norvasc had a 15 percent lower death rate from all causes than those taking beta blockers, a different type of blood pressure drug. Deaths from heart attacks and other cardiovascular events alone were 25 percent lower in patients taking Norvasc. But Norvasc failed to show a statistically significant reduction in deaths from fatal coronary heart disease, the initial goal of the trial.	0
Dr. Freedman said there was a reason for the imbalance: Sam Shapiro, the study director, had better data on the women in the screened group than in the control group, since he was following the screened women closely, with mammograms and office visits. So he was more likely to notice if they had already had breast cancer. But does this flaw cast serious doubts on the conclusions? Here, the two experts disagree. Dr. Berry says the trial's conclusion rests on a difference of 43 deaths from breast cancer after 18 years. And, he says, there were 500 more women excluded from the screened group than from the control group. If just 10 percent of those 500 women died of breast cancer, and if they had remained in the study group where they were originally assigned, that would have been an additional 50 breast cancer deaths. That result, Dr. Berry said, would more than eliminate the positive effect that the study found from screening.	1
A microneedle had squeezed out all the genetic material from a freshly harvested human egg. Now, in the shadows of a darkened laboratory, a technician in a blue jumpsuit prodded and probed the egg's outer membrane on Monday morning, seeking to introduce a skin cell from a patient with an immune deficiency. Finally, on the third probe, the rubbery wall gave way. Magnified 250 times on a black-and-white screen, the egg could be seen making room for the new skin cell, with its new genetic code. ''I never destroy any life during my process,'' said Dr. Woo Suk Hwang, the laboratory director, his eyes flashing above his surgical mask as he gave a reporter a rare look at the controversial human-cell transfer process developed at this small lab on the sixth floor of Building No. 85 at Seoul National University. To his supporters, Dr. Hwang's report on May 20 that he had created new colonies of stem cells that matched the DNA of their donors was a major leap toward the dream of growing replacement tissues for conditions like spinal cord injuries, juvenile diabetes and congenital immune deficiencies.	0
OBESITY is considered a major public health problem today, but a number of scientists are coming to see it as a comparative blessing, given the alternative. These public heath experts believe, in effect, that America may have traded smoking -- a truly lethal habit -- for the lesser deadliness of eating too much. The story of this trade-off can be seen in the data. From 1973 until 1983, Americans were actually growing thinner. During that period, the average weight of middle-aged men fell about two pounds, while that of middle-aged women fell nearly three pounds. Then the trend reversed: from 1980 to 2000, the average weight of Americans rose by nearly 20 pounds. Everyone got heavier, said Dr. David Williamson, a statistician at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ''Competitive cyclists weigh more than they did 20, 30 years ago; HIV patients weigh more.'' Yet the nation also is healthier. Life expectancy has gone up by more than six years over the past three decades, and heart disease, long the major killer, is on the wane.	1
An egg has a full number of chromosomes right up until fertilization, when it ejects half of them and receives a half set from the sperm. So if this ejection is suppressed, an egg will have the full number of chromosomes. The embryos created this way would not be clones of the woman, Dr. Hall said, because the chromosomes in an egg are somewhat different from the woman's set. Still, he said, the tissues derived from stem cells from such embryos would be close enough to a woman's own tissues that they would not be rejected if transplanted back into the woman. Another possible way to develop such compatible tissues is to use stem cells made by cloning the patient's own cells. The idea, known as therapeutic cloning, is to take genetic material from a patient's cell and fuse it with an egg that is missing its own nucleus, creating an embryo that is a genetic copy of the patient. But because an embryo made through that method would in theory be able to develop into a person, Roman Catholic authorities and other abortion opponents have objected.	0
Dr. FitzGerald's line of questioning began in 1998, with a paper published the week Celebrex was put on the market. In it, he showed that if he blocked COX-2 in mice, blood vessels constricted and narrowed, and platelets, which are involved in blood clotting, become active. ''We saw this and said, 'This is not good,''' Dr. FitzGerald said. He continued to probe the biochemistry, but not everyone was convinced, and even Dr. FitzGerald decided that the drugs' benefits -- they relieved pain and were less likely to cause stomach bleeding -- outweighed for some patients what he saw as their heart attack risks. But he was not surprised when the colon cancer prevention studies showed that both Vioxx and Celebrex were associated with an increased incidence of heart disease. Some scientists point out, however, that no one has ever studied older drugs that inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 to see whether they also increase heart attack risk. The Aleve data are preliminary, not conclusive, but they are among the first to address the question for an older drug. Other such drugs include Mobic, indomethacin, and diclofenac.	1
Kolata knows this. She touches on reasons that poor people are more likely than rich people to be overweight, all of them environmental. But she treats childhood obesity as virtually inevitable. In addition to the twin and adoption studies, she cites research showing that teaching kids to eat right in school, and serving them leaner lunches, has no effect on their weights. The researchers concluded that the intervention was too limited -- the children's diets needed to change at home as well as at school. But Kolata scoffs at the ''popular solution,'' which is ''not to question the premise but rather to increase the intensity of the intervention.'' Given the rise in obesity, however, is it really credible to put all the blame on our genes -- and ignore the gazillion-dollar food industry? And while it's useful to point out that obese people don't have higher rates of anxiety, depression or mood disorders, that doesn't mean these conditions are never a factor in causing obesity in those who are genetically susceptible to it. As some of the testimony of Kolata's own dieters attests, we eat not just because our appetites drive us to but because our psyches do, in search of both pleasure and relief from pain or stress.	0
Now, Ms. Terry said, the gene has been found. She worked with the Genetic Alliance, an advocacy group in Washington for people with genetic diseases, in formulating the contract. ''More and more of our organizations are interested in this, and they become savvy very fast,'' said Mary Davidson, the alliance's executive director. The groups are familiar with the Canavan disease story and they have taken careful note, she said. But there can be a danger in demanding too much too soon. ''People may find that if they overreach in these contracts, the thing that they felt so valuable is something no one is interested in pursuing,'' said Robert P. Merges, a law professor specializing in patent law at the University of California at Berkeley. That happened to a Boston family whose members had long life spans, which made them of great interest to Dr. Thomas Perls, a gerontologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. The family told Dr. Perls that he could use their tissue to search for a longevity gene, but only if the medical center paid a huge sum of money. Dr. Perls refused.	1
''The issue we tried to address is how do we mobilize America's incredibly fragmented health system to really get this done,'' said David Lansky, a director of the health program at the Markle Foundation, which coordinated the work of the organizations involved, including the American Health Information Management Association, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society and the Liberty Alliance Project. The study was delivered to the Bush administration's national health information technology coordinator, Dr. David J. Brailer, who had asked for recommendations on how to build a national health information network. The 54-page document, which the group calls a ''common framework,'' borrows heavily from the technical and policy approach of the Internet. The federal government, the report says, should guide the development of a health network with a light hand by providing some initial financing and endorsing basic technical standards, but should set up a separate ''standards and policy entity'' to handle the task.	0
The South African scientist who admitted falsifying data in a closely watched breast cancer study was dismissed today, six weeks after American researchers reviewing his work uncovered the fraud and alerted officials at his employer here, the University of the Witwatersrand. The scientist, Werner Bezwoda, claimed in a study showcased last year at the annual meeting of the American College of Clinical Oncology to have found that high-dose chemotherapy, done in conjunction with bone-marrow transplantation, prolonged the lives of some women with advanced breast cancer. It was the only study among five presented that supported the taxing treatment, and its remarkable findings were the talk of cancer researchers, who started looking at how to test the treatment on a far bigger sample of patients. But in a news conference today after a disciplinary hearing for Dr. Bezwoda, Colin Bundy, the vice chancellor of Witwatersrand, said the university concluded that he had misrepresented the results of his study and misled colleagues, the public and, most importantly, his patients.	0
Eldridge Lee, a real estate broker and adjunct college professor in Fairburn, Ga., found out that he had Type 2 diabetes more than a decade ago. But he did not take the disease seriously until two years ago, when sky-high blood pressure -- a complication of diabetes -- led to heart disease. ''After coming out of heart surgery, I was sitting with a ventilator down my throat and had a moment of realization that the diabetes, which I had pretty much been ignoring, had led to this problem with my heart,'' said Mr. Lee, 53, who now controls his blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar with diet, exercise and six drugs. Like Mr. Lee, many of the nation's 17 million diabetics -- and even their doctors -- miss the connection between high blood pressure and diabetes. Studies show that cardiovascular disease, set off mainly by hypertension, is the leading cause of death among people with diabetes, and two of every three diabetes-related deaths are caused by heart disease or stroke.	0
The infielder said he often heard players muttering that an opponent is ''juiced'' after a home run. ''I've heard it a bunch of times,'' he said. ''It's the first thing that comes to mind when someone hits one really deep. Oh, he's on steroids.'' Darrin Jackson, an outfielder who retired from the Chicago White Sox last year, said he sometimes found it difficult to resist the suspicion that other players were using muscle-building drugs. ''I've even heard myself say that,'' Jackson said. ''I go home and all winter long I work out five days a week with a personal trainer and I come back maybe 10 pounds heavier. You say, 'How did this guy put on 30 pounds over the winter?' '' Anabolic steroids are derivatives or precursors of testosterone, the body's main muscle builder. They allow an athlete to gain more muscle mass in less time by helping the body recover faster from workouts.	0
Patients respond differently to statins, with some achieving more success in cholesterol reduction than others, Dr. Snow said. But, she said, ''our goal is not necessarily to get to a certain level of cholesterol, but to decrease heart attacks and strokes, and you can reduce that risk with a certain dose of statin.''	0
Dr. Mitchell Creinin runs an abortion clinic in Pittsburgh and has become something of an expert on the abortion-inducing pill, mifepristone, which was approved for sale in the United States on Thursday. Dr. Creinin has provided the pill to women in research studies, and he has traveled the country giving seminars to doctors who are considering offering the drug to their patients. But, he said, while hundreds of doctors -- family practitioners and obstetricians -- have attended his  seminars thinking that they could begin providing mifepristone to patients seeking abortions, their eagerness to prescribe the pill often diminished as they heard him talk. Mifepristone has been hailed as a change in the politics of abortion, making a decision to end a pregnancy a private matter between a woman and her doctor. Supporters have predicted that the pill will lead to more doctors providing abortions. Doctors, some hoped, would simply provide mifepristone pills in the same way as they might write a prescription for birth control pills. But the reality, in the immediate future, at least, could be different. In fact, acceptance of the pill and the character of the national debate on abortion may be decided in the fall  election. [News analysis, Page A10.]	1
There is one point that comes up again and again in discussions of Slavin and Moore and Catalona: like it or not, we live in a market-driven society, and science is part of that market. For Baruch Blumberg, the researcher who used Ted Slavin's antibodies in his hepatitis B research, that is a reality that science is still learning to navigate. During my visits to the Fox Chase Cancer Center to meet with O'Connell and learn about Slavin, I drove around Philadelphia with Blumberg, who is now 80. After decades of hepatitis B research, he needed a break from focusing on so much illness, suffering and death, and so he spent a few years working with NASA, studying the origin of life forms. In the car one evening, I asked Blumberg what he thought about the debate over tissue ownership. Instead of answering, he told me how the technology for air bags came from medical devices designed by NASA. I asked again, and he pointed out Venus and Mars, which were bright and hovering above us. Finally, after my third try, he turned to me and sighed. ''Whether you think the commercialization of medical research is good or bad depends on how into capitalism you are,'' he said. On the whole, Blumberg said, commercialization is good -- how else would we get the drugs and diagnostic tests we need? Still, he sees a downside. ''I think it's fair to say it's interfered with science,'' he told me, gazing up at the sky. ''It's changed the spirits.'' Now there are patents and proprietary information where there was free information flow, he said.	0
Three other health centers upstate and one on Long Island will also take part. Dr. Henschke said she would be the project's principal investigator. Patients have converged on many radiologists and other doctors who offer the CT scan, hoping to detect potentially deadly tumors as early as possible. Lung cancer is the country's leading cause of cancer deaths, with about 157,000 each year. ''I don't think recruitment is going to be a problem,'' Dr. Mitchell said. But the popularity of spiral CT screening is troubling to some doctors, including Dr. Barnett Kramer of the National Institutes of Health, who believe the scans may help cancer detection but do nothing to help patients live longer. Despite those concerns, ''Most people believe this is worthy of a trial,'' Dr. Stocker said. Correction:  August 22, 2000, Tuesday  An article yesterday about a medical study of an experimental X-ray screening test for diagnosing and treating early stages of lung cancer paraphrased one doctor's concerns about the test incorrectly. The doctor, Barnett Kramer of the National Institutes of Health, says that although the test, known as spiral CT screening, may help cancer detection, whether it will help patients live longer remains undetermined. He did not say that the test does nothing to help patients live longer.	0
In one of the most expansive collaborations between a major medical center and a New York community hospital, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will help establish a cancer prevention and treatment center at the North General Hospital in Harlem, executives at both centers said yesterday. The center will be known as the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Prevention and Care, reflecting a $5 million gift from the fashion designer's company. The creation of the center, which is expected to be announced today, springs in part from years of research demonstrating large disparities between blacks and whites in cancer detection and survival rates, as well as Mr. Lauren's interest in breast cancer philanthropy. The center also reflects a subtle but significant shift in the role that Sloan-Kettering, now under the leadership of Dr. Harold Varmus, plays in areas where most people lack access to basic care, let alone the cutting-edge research and high-profile doctors for which Sloan-Kettering is internationally known.	0
''Privacy is just that much more on people's minds these days,'' said John Gilmore, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet and civil rights group. People are starting to hear about friends who have had their Social Security numbers or credit card numbers stolen. Or they have read news reports about DoubleClick, an Internet advertising company that had planned to match data about people's surfing habits with information identifying the people involved. ''The relentless advertising nature of so many of the commercial Internet companies is partly driving the public reaction,'' Mr. Gilmore said. ''People are saying, We don't want this.'' To reach this new market, cryptographers are starting to realize that they must become less of an enigma to people. Zero-Knowledge, for example, has started posting essays under the heading Demystifying Cryptography on its Web site. Meanwhile, the companies are enjoying the kind of growth familiar to Internet start-ups, and the perks as well. Hush Communications, now based in Ireland, has doubled in size in the last few months to include more than 30 people. Anonymizer.com has an arcade game in its office, offers its employees unlimited soft drinks and will soon move into a larger office in downtown San Diego.  Zero-Knowledge has swelled to 200 employees; it is building a new office in Montreal with a massage room, a cappuccino stand, a rooftop terrace and free laundry services (a bonus to computer programmers who come from a culture that values smart code over personal hygiene).	0

Most scientists say Dr. Mattick's views, although intriguing, are not backed by much evidence. Rather than upending the central dogma, they say, the new findings just add some tenets. It has long been known that RNA is more than a messenger. The ribosome, which makes proteins, is made partly of RNA. Another type of RNA, called transfer RNA, aids in protein production. Some scientists say it is not surprising that RNA has multiple roles, because it is generally believed that RNA had the role of both proteins and DNA in the early days of life on earth. ''We still have a lot of remnants from that,'' said Dr. Stephen R. Holbrook, a scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The recent excitement has been generated by two discoveries related to small RNA snippets and their ability to turn off genes. Some genes, scientists found, produce tiny RNA's, known as micro-RNA's or miRNA, which are about 21 to 23 bases, or letters, in length. The micro-RNA's bind to matching pieces of messenger RNA, turn it into a double strand and keep it from doing its job. The process effectively stifles the production of the corresponding protein.	0
Now Pfizer says it has changed its strategy. Dr. Joseph Feczko, Pfizer's chief medical officer, said Monday that Pfizer expected to offer torcetrapib as a standalone drug as well as a combination with Lipitor. The change comes in part because of the criticism that Pfizer has faced, Dr. Feczko said. ''We didn't appreciate how this would be perceived,'' he said. As a result, patients will be able to take torcetrapib alongside whatever statin they now use, or even as a standalone pill, though Pfizer expects that doctors will generally prescribe torcetrapib as a complement to statins, not by itself. Whatever Pfizer's motives for the change, the company's action is positive, said Dr. Bruce M. Psaty, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Washington. ''This seems like an appropriate way to bring a potentially important drug to market,'' he said. ''Flexibility is important.'' Dr. Steven Nissen, president of the American College of Cardiology, lauded Pfizer for its decision. ''They're doing the right thing,'' he said. ''Pfizer is allowing physicians to make intelligent choices for patients.''	0
He said the athletes were so competitive that they pushed themselves to exhaustion. ''We had the world cross-country cycling champion on his knees,'' Dr. Benardot said. The test puts athletes on a bicycle connected to a computer. The computer adds 7 percent of the athlete's body weight as resistance, and then the athlete sprints as hard as he or she can for 30 seconds. Five minutes later, the athlete does it again. Not only did those eating the energy bars do better on the test, they also said they did not feel hungry and that they felt more vigorous, Dr. Benardot said. And, to his astonishment, the changes occurred in just two weeks. ''After the study was over, those who had the bars kept coming to us saying: 'Do you have any more of those bars? What was in them, really?' '' Dr. Benardot said. ''Some of them thought it was illegal.''	1
Many Christians who are active in the evolving anti-birth-control arena state frankly that what links their efforts is a religious commitment to altering the moral landscape of the country. In particular, and not to put too fine a point on it, they want to change the way Americans have sex. Dr. Stanford, the F.D.A. adviser on reproductive-health drugs, proclaimed himself ''fully committed to promoting an understanding of human sexuality and procreation radically at odds with the prevailing views and practices of our contemporary culture.'' Focus on the Family posts a kind of contraceptive warning label on its Web site: ''Modern contraceptive inventions have given many an exaggerated sense of safety and prompted more people than ever before to move sexual expression outside the marriage boundary.'' Contraception, by this logic, encourages sexual promiscuity, sexual deviance (like homosexuality) and a preoccupation with sex that is unhealthful even within marriage. It may be news to many people that contraception as a matter of right and public health is no longer a given, but politicians and those in the public health profession know it well. ''The linking of abortion and contraception is indicative of a larger agenda, which is putting sex back into the box, as something that happens only within marriage,'' says William Smith, vice president for public policy for the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States. Siecus has been around since 1964, and as a group that supports abortion rights, it is natural enemies with many organizations on the right, but its mission has changed in recent years, from doing things like promoting condoms as a way to combat AIDS to, now, fighting to maintain the very idea of birth control as a social good. ''Whether it's emergency contraception, sex education or abortion, anything that might be seen as facilitating sex outside a marital context is what they'd like to see obliterated,'' Smith says.	0
Even so, critics maintain that concierge services violate the spirit, if not the letter, of federal Medicare law, which aspires to regulate doctors' fees to a uniform standard and streamline access to medical care for the old and infirm. After five senators wrote a letter of complaint to the Department of Health and Human Services in 2002, a formal examination was begun. Tommy G. Thompson, who headed the department at that time, concluded that as long as the retainer fee was clearly for services not covered by Medicare, collecting the fees did not violate the law. Subsequently, the Government Accountability Office examined trends in concierge medicine and concluded, in a report in August 2005, that the number of concierge physicians nationwide was still too small for the practice to limit Medicare patients' access to health care, but that the government would continue to monitor trends. Some argue that concierge services actually save health care dollars. In Florida, for instance, internal MDVIP statistics indicate that concierge patients receive screening exams like mammograms and Pap smears more regularly than those with commercial insurance, and they require fewer hospital admissions, said Darin Engelhardt, the company's chief financial officer.	0
Many doctors say that for women to turn their backs on hormone replacement therapy would be a gross overreaction. ''I don't think we should throw out the baby with the bath water just because of this one study,'' said Dr. Daniel R. Mishell, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine. Dr. Mishell and others point out that the increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular problems for a woman in the federal study was small. Many doctors still say that taking hormones for two to four years, to treat temporary symptoms of menopause, is probably safe for most women. And the fact is, nothing else works as well as estrogen to relieve hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Still, the news from the Women's Health Initiative study is prompting a reassessment of the standard regimen of hormone replacement therapy. It seems likely that in the months ahead, many doctors will be prescribing formulations of estrogen and progestin that are tailored to each woman's health and personal preferences. Some women will opt for lower doses, and some will forgo hormones altogether in favor of other remedies.	0
Doubts about mammography are not new. Though many women and their doctors think of annual mammograms after age 40 as normal and necessary, there have long been vocal skeptics. Their dissident view about the usefulness of mammograms may seem to have been fully validated by the study published this fall in The Lancet, concluding that women who have mammography die of breast cancer at the same rate as those who don't. But the issue of breast cancer screening isn't so easily settled. For most of the 20th century, physicians thought that breast cancer was a local disease that only spread to the rest of the body late in its course. Early detection, they assumed, meant that the cancer would be caught and treated before it could kill. So it made perfect sense that the American Cancer Society began in the 1950's to encourage women to perform breast self-examinations and in the 1970's to recommend mammograms.	0
Despite this push, Dr. Manson said women should not assume that new versions are safer. ''Until proven otherwise we should assume all medications in a similar class have similar risk,'' she said. ''It's biologically plausible that a lower dose might have a lower risk but we don't know yet.'' Natalie de Vane, a spokeswoman for Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, the maker of Prempro and Premarin, confirmed that the new low-dose versions were playing an important role in stabilizing sales. But she acknowledged that the new products had not been studied as extensively as those examined in the Women's Health Initiative. ''We do not have data evaluating those particular risks,'' she said. ''Regardless of the dose, the decision to initiate or continue therapy needs to be made on an individual basis, taking into account a woman's treatment goals, and personal medical history.'' Part of the confusion surrounding the subject comes from the difficulty in making those kinds of judgments. Because no significant benefits were found for older women taking hormones, for them, any increase in risk was judged to be unacceptable.	0
Nonetheless, most ambulances do not consider stroke center designations when they transport patients. And, said John Becknell, a spokesman for the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians, national programs can be difficult because every community has its own rules for which ambulances pick up patients and where they take them. As a result, most stroke patients have no access to the recommended care and even fewer get M.R.I.'s, a situation Dr. Warach said he found appalling. ''How can it ever be in the patient's best interest to have an inferior diagnosis?'' he asked. ''It borders on malpractice that given a choice between two noninvasive tests, one of which is clearly superior, the worse test is the one that is preferred.'' Averting Catastrophe In those awful moments when she realized she had had a stroke, Dr. Fite, unlike most patients, knew what to do. She told the ambulance crew to take her to Memorial Hermann Hospital, even though it was about an hour away. She knew that it was one of the Houston stroke centers, that Dr. Grotta worked there, and that its doctors had experience diagnosing strokes and giving tPA.	1
The length of time that Poehlman perpetrated his fraud -- 10 years -- and its scope make his case unique, even among the most egregious examples of scientific misconduct. Some scientists believe that his ability to beat the system for so long had as much to do with the research topics he chose as with his aggressive tactics. His work was prominent, but none of his studies broke new scientific ground. (This may also be why no other scientists working in the field have retracted papers as a result of Poehlman's fraud.) By testing undisputed assumptions on popular topics, Poehlman attracted enough attention to maintain his status but not enough to invite suspicion. Moreover, replicating his longitudinal data would be expensive and difficult to do. ''Eric excelled at telling us what we wanted to hear,'' Matthews, Poehlman's former colleague, told me. ''He published results that confirmed our predisposed hypotheses.'' Steven Heymsfield, an obesity researcher at Merck Pharmaceuticals in New Jersey, echoed Matthews's sentiments and added that Poehlman's success owed more to his business sense and charisma than to his aptitude as a scientist.	0

New Jersey lost 7 percent of its mammography centers over the last 18 months alone, going to 263 facilities from 283. Since 1994, there has been an overall drop of 9.6 percent in the state, mirroring national declines. By contrast, the number of women in the state receiving mammograms is increasing. About 451,000 women in the state turn 40 each year, the age at which health officials advise women to begin mammogram testing. Most authorities regard mammograms as the best available tool for early cancer detection despite some widely reported -- and widely disputed -- studies suggesting that regular mammograms do not lower the risk of dying from cancer. ''With more and more women becoming eligible and more and more facilities closing it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that pretty soon there will be a vast access problem,'' said Joshua J. Cooper, the Congressional relations director for the American College of Radiology, a professional society for radiologists, radiation oncologists and medical physicists.	0
Dr. Nissen says he focuses on L.D.L. so much that he mostly discounts H.D.L. in deciding whether to give cholesterol-lowering drugs to patients with heart disease or to those with high L.D.L. levels and other risk factors like high blood pressure or a family history of heart disease. He notes that statins are safe drugs that reduce L.D.L. levels and that study after study has shown that lowering L.D.L. prevents heart attacks and deaths. He says that recent research bears him out. His study, published this month in the Journal of the American Medical Association, looked directly at the accumulation of plaque in coronary arteries when heart patients took cholesterol-lowering drugs. Their H.D.L. levels, he said, played no role in plaque growth; the only thing that mattered was what happened to L.D.L. When L.D.L. levels dropped, plaque growth slowed. That means, Dr. Nissen concludes, that the benefit of lowering L.D.L. is the same whether H.D.L. levels are high or low.	1
In State Supreme Court in Brooklyn in 1986, Dr. DiBlasio was convicted of possessing and selling narcotics and sentenced to 21 years to life in prison. The following year, the state revoked his license to practice medicine. But Dr. DiBlasio appealed his criminal convictions and the license revocation. Eventually, his conviction for selling drugs was overturned. At retrial, he was convicted of a less serious charge, possession of a controlled substance (cocaine), and  was released from jail in early 1992, state records show. From there, Dr. DiBlasio began the numerous appeals that led to the reinstatement of his medical license in 1995. Dr. Bier's past troubles stemmed from billing practices, said officials who once worked for an insurance carrier, Group Health Inc., that has an extensive network of doctors that had included Dr. Bier. In the early 1990's, a standard review of the doctors' practices revealed that Dr. Bier's bills were roughly $80,000 a year higher on average than other radiologists', and that he was ordering hundreds more tests than the others, said Harvey Schachter, the former vice president for professional affairs at G.H.I.	0
The other problem I hadn't attributed to menopause was depression. I chalked it up to my kids growing up and leaving home. But as soon as I started on hormones, that disappeared, too, and my energy returned. I did have problems with breakthrough bleeding, which isn't something you want to deal with after you haven't had your period for a while. They tried a D. &amp; C., then increased my progestin, but I gained a lot of weight. I seriously considered going off hormones because of that, but I kept coming back to how  much better it made me feel. Now I'm taking a new drug, femhrt, which is a synthetic and has a smaller dose of progestin. I'm feeling much better. But I will admit the breast cancer piece is worrisome. The only person in my family who had it was my maternal aunt, and I decided she was far enough removed in the family tree to not make that a major factor in my decision.	???
The study also found that children who ate family dinners often tended to have healthier diets throughout the day. ''In terms of teaching your children good habits, the dinner table is great,'' said Dr. Michael Rosenbaum, an associate professor of clinical pediatrics and medicine at New York Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia University, who did not participate in the study. ''It's not like saying, 'do your homework before television,' '' he added. ''It's a fun  way to teach healthy habits. No one can set a better example regarding healthy eating than parents. And there is a tremendous amount of data to show that healthy habits learned early persist into adulthood.'' Dr. Loraine Stern, co-editor of ''The American Academy of Pediatrics Guide to Your Child's Nutrition'' (Villard, 1999), said: ''We know that families that sit together and have civilized meals can instill better eating habits. It's not because parents are more directive about what children eat, because that can be counterproductive to be so controlling. It's because when parents share meals, it usually means there are more healthful choices on the table.''	0
Dr. Kaminetsky counters with his own story. Had he not found this way of practicing medicine, he said, he would no longer be seeing patients at all: he would be in a desk job with a pharmaceutical company. A detail-oriented perfectionist who routinely works through lunch and still does his own filing, he was tormented in his previous practice by the impossibility of meeting his own standards. ''I hated it,'' Dr. Kaminetsky said. ''It was awful. Patients always had a litany of complaints. Driving home, I would think, 'Oh my God, I never saw this test, I never called that patient back.' Some people are not as easily distressed by loose ends. I don't like leaving things undone.'' Now on his busiest days he sees perhaps half the number of patients he used to, spends twice as long with each one and has the time to make every last phone call.	0
''As far as I'm concerned, we're saving Medicare money,'' Dr. Kaminetsky said. He pointed to cases like that of Philip Novack, 94. For Mr. Novack, who is in fragile health, Dr. Kaminetsky's office often becomes a low-stress alternative to the emergency room. One morning last summer, Mr. Novack woke up at 5 a.m. feeling unwell and asked his wife, Edythe Shane-Novack, to call an ambulance. A veteran of many similar emergencies, she waited till 9:02 a.m. and called Dr. Kaminetsky's office instead. Less than three hours later Mr. Novack was perched on an examining table, smiling at the familiar faces in the office and receiving the same evaluation he would have had in the emergency room, including blood tests, an X-ray and a cardiogram. The diagnosis, a slight imbalance in his blood sodium level, was made promptly, and Mr. Novack was better by the next morning. Instead of paying expensive emergency fees, Medicare would pay only for an office visit. ''This is the best thing that ever happened to us,'' Mrs. Shane-Novack said.	0
Medical experts predict that the number of pertussis cases will continue to grow rapidly over the next few years until a large part of the population has been exposed and develops immunity. In the meantime, public health officials warn parents to protect their infants by strictly adhering to vaccination schedules. Delaying inoculations by even a month or two can make children more vulnerable. And experts say to keep babies away from people who have coughs. ''Don't think grandma just has a cold because maybe not,'' Dr. Cortese said.	0
''It's better than anything we had hoped for,'' said Dr. Dale Schenk,  Elan's vice president of neurobiology. ''We actually think the vaccine is stimulating the immune system to come in and take up the plaque.'' Dr. Ivan M. Lieberburg, senior vice president of research at Elan Pharmaceuticals, said the company was ''moving forward to clinical trials aggressively.'' The Elan researchers immunized the mice with a synthetic form of the beta-amyloid peptide, which is the predominant compound found in the plaques in patients' brains. They linked the peptide to an immune system stimulus, or adjuvant, that is commonly used in mouse studies. The adjuvant prompts the immune system to attack the amyloid plaques it would otherwise ignore. The adjuvant used in the mice is not tolerated by people, though the researchers said that designing one that was tolerated was not regarded as a major hurdle. The mice had been implanted with a mutated human gene that prompts the overproduction of amyloid, but that mutation is only found in a minority of actual Alzheimer's patients, those with so-called familial Alzheimer's, rather than the more common sporadic form. People with sporadic Alzheimer's do not overproduce amyloid, but instead seem to have a problem clearing it from the body. The only way to determine whether the vaccine is effective for them would be through clinical trials.	0
Dr. Fox noted that ''there are states that screen for galactosemia, and that incidence is 1 in 60,000, and states that don't screen for sickle cell anemia, and that incidence is 1 in 600.'' ''That's a reason to have this task force,'' Dr. Fox added. Another reason is the march of technology. Tandem mass spectrometry, which can precisely and efficiently count blood components that become elevated with certain disorders, is catching on. And as some states start using it, the gap between them and states that do not may become a chasm. New parents can ask their hospitals to order the testing, but most do not even know to ask, and most hospitals do not offer it routinely. Dr. Edwin W. Naylor, president of Neo Gen Screening Inc. of Pittsburgh, the leading private laboratory specializing in spectrometry testing, estimates that, based on data he has collected, of the four million babies born in the United States every year, about 1,000 suffer from conditions, mainly metabolic disorders, that can only be screened for by using tandem mass spectrometry.	0
As it turns out, the debates have paralyzed the political system not only on the broadest issue -- whether and how to move to universal health insurance -- but also on what seems, at first glance, a narrow one. Otherwise, it wouldn't be this hard. The elderly are supposed to be the 800-pound gorillas of American politics, the ones who show up, disproportionately, to vote and whose needs get met, pronto. And it is difficult to argue with their needs. While more than two-thirds of the elderly piece together some coverage for drugs, mostly from former employers or H.M.O.'s, their coverage is increasingly limited and unreliable. And the cost of drugs keeps climbing. Medicare beneficiaries spent an average of $813, out of pocket, on prescription drugs in 2000 and $928 in 2001, and are spending $1,051 in 2002, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group. A reporter visiting senior centers with Congressional candidates routinely hears older people, on the verge of tears, recite their monthly bills and their monthly Social Security check and plead for help. The oldest are among the most vulnerable; an estimated 45 percent of those 85 and older have no prescription drug coverage.	0
The moment registration opens, Michele D. Hannah dives for courses with the fury of a fifth-year college student vexed by a constant riddle. ''When will I get the classes I need to graduate?'' said Ms. Hannah, Class of ''I have no idea'' at the University of Iowa. Classes have gotten so tight, or so scarce, that Ms. Hannah says she trolls the university's Web site like a day trader, checking every few hours for the stray course opening that might suddenly appear. But it probably will not. At many public universities, grappling with record budget cuts and enrollments at the same time, the classroom is no longer being spared. After whittling away at staff, coaxing faculty members to juggle more classes, stripping sports teams and trusting aging roofs to hold out a few years longer, many public universities have reluctantly begun chopping away at academics, making it harder for students to graduate on time.	0
Other companies have declined to publish commercially valuable genetic sequence data, not writing papers at all, and selling the data instead. ''We're trying to run a business here, not put things in Science magazine,'' said Roy Whitfield, the chief executive of Incyte Genomics, a company in Palo Alto, Calif., that has genetic sequences of individual human genes. But the human genome sequence papers were widely thought to be of historic importance, scientists said. So, Dr. Kennedy said, he spent months listening to researchers with opinions on what he should require Celera to do. He relied on neutral negotiators to serve as go-betweens. ''We heard from a number of people saying, 'What are you doing? What are you up to?'' Dr. Kennedy said. ''Are you going to violate the traditional norms of scientific publication?' '' He said leaders of the public genome project told him that whether they would publish in Science or a competing journal depended on whether they were comfortable with Science's decision about Celera's data.	1
The letter was signed by luminaries from an array of disciplines. Among the Nobel winners are David Baltimore and Harold Varmus, both biomedical researchers, and Leon M. Lederman, Norman F. Ramsey and Steven Weinberg, who are physicists. The full list of signatories and the union's report can be found at www.ucsusa.org. Aside from some new interviews with current and former government scientists, some identified in the report and others quoted anonymously, most of the information in the documents had been reported previously by a variety of major newspapers, magazines, scientific journals and nongovernmental organizations. According to the report, the Bush administration has misrepresented scientific consensus on global warming, censored at least one report on climate change, manipulated scientific findings on the emissions of mercury from power plants and suppressed information on condom use. The report asserts that the administration also allowed industries with conflicts of interest to influence technical advisory committees, disbanded for political reasons one panel on arms control and subjected other prospective members of scientific panels to political litmus tests.	0
But the study has little relevance to the current understanding of how to control weight, said Dr. Stunkard, who specializes in the treatment of obesity and eating disorders. The 100 patients in the study were ''just given a diet and sent on their way,'' he said. ''That was state of the art in 1959,'' he added. ''I've been sort of surprised that people keep citing it; I know we do better these days.'' The intervening years have brought significant changes to the treatment of obesity, the most important of which, Dr. Stunkard said, has been the introduction of behavior modification techniques. Since the 1959 study, though, the statistic has been reinforced by most  other clinical studies, which also showed people with discouraging results. ''Unless we can prove they're typical, the data cannot be generalized,'' Dr. Brownell said. ''The people we see in clinics tend to be more overweight and have more psychological problems. They are more likely by a factor of two to have binge-eating problems.''	???
Clonaid has a list of a hundred people who have expressed interest in its services, most of them would-be parents with severe infertility problems, a handful of them homosexual couples. ''In some cases,'' Boisselier conceded, ''they could go to a sperm bank and so on, but they felt better about having a child with their own genes. I think it's probably written in us to have a succession of our genes.'' But lately, she was getting calls mainly from the parents of children who have died -- infants, teenagers, young adults -- though few of the callers had the foresight, or whatever one would call it, to freeze the tissue that would make cloning the dead even theoretically possible. Boisselier finished her salad and started in on a story about a woman she knows who was badly injured in a car accident, and who, though she eventually recovered physically, lost all memory of her previous life. At first, I couldn't see where this was going. ''Her family could hardly recognize her,'' she explained. ''Because she has no memory of the past, no emotions connected to it.'' That must have been hard for the family, I said. ''Yes, they were surprised,'' said Boisselier, who then added -- and this turned out to be the point of the story -- This lady was a good example of what a clone would be.'' That is, she looked the same, but lacked the experiences and associations that had made her dear to the people who wanted to bring her back in the first place. It was an indictment of the whole concept, and yet Boisselier didn't seem remotely aware of this, didn't seem to realize that if a person was unique and therefore by definition irreplaceable, then the quest to replace him was misguided and the encouragement of it cruel. Either our genes determine us or they don't, but if they don't, then cloning for the purpose of replicating a person is pointless. It holds forth the promise of unprecedented control -- manufacturing a human being who will share specific traits with a preapproved model -- but it cannot deliver.	0
Now, here's a scary statistic: although all American health care workers are strongly urged to get a flu shot each year, fewer than 40 percent typically do. According to flu experts, many doctors and nurses still don't realize the extent to which their personal lack of immunization threatens the health -- or even survival -- of their patients. In recent weeks, several major health organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Nurses Association and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations have proposed recommendations aimed at greatly increasing that vaccination rate. A few groups have called for making influenza immunizations mandatory for nearly all health care workers. Most other organizations, including the C.D.C., stop short of that and suggest instead that hospitals and other medical institutions should bear more responsibility for educating employees and for making the vaccine more available throughout every shift, perhaps offering it free. All the groups agree that patients' lives are at stake.	0
Boston Scientific said yesterday that it supported the creation of an industrywide, independent safety board. James R. Tobin, chief executive of Boston Scientific, based in Natick, Mass, also said the company was adopting all the medical group's recommendations. The other two major heart device producers, Medtronic and St. Jude Medical, said separately that they were reviewing the safety board proposal. ''We want to look at it and talk about it some more,'' said Robert Clark, a spokesman for Medtronic, which is the country's biggest maker of defibrillators. Mr. Clark also said that Medtronic calls on outside experts on an ad hoc basis when a potential safety problem arises. But several experts said that such a system relied on company executives to decide that a problem existed, while outside experts might make that call more quickly. ''When you are a member of the team, it is hard not to think about the interests of the team rather than looking at the bigger picture,'' said Dr. Robert J. Myerburg, a professor of medicine at the University of Miami who headed the Guidant panel.	0
How long women should take letrozole is unknown. Because the study ended early, the data only show its effects for about two years. Dr. Abrams said the women in the study would be followed, providing information on whether the drug continues to be effective. But there will no longer be a placebo group. Also unknown is if every woman who has taken tamoxifen for five years should start on letrozole. Women just coming off of tamoxifen should strongly consider it, researchers say. But there are no answers yet for women who stopped taking tamoxifen six months ago or longer. ''That's going to be one of the challenges,'' Dr. Ingle said. ''We do not have clinical trial evidence,'' he noted, ''but because breast cancer risk continues indefinitely, there is no reason to think women wouldn't benefit.'' Another issue to be resolved is whether letrozole is the best of the aromatase inhibitors. Two other aromatase inhibitors are on the market: anastrozole, which AstraZeneca sells as Arimidex, and exemestane, which Pfizer sells as Aromasin. Studies are under way to assess their effectiveness in protecting against breast cancer recurrences.	1
Stony Brook was in the top quarter of hospitals nationwide for heart attack patients, and was one of the better large hospitals on the Island on all three of the Hospital Compare measures. Still, it failed to deliver appropriate care in dozens of cases. ''There are a lot of doctors who don't follow the guidelines, and aren't up to date on the literature,'' said Dr. Brown. ''That's what these public scorecards are designed to do -- embarrass or educate people to do things the right way. They may think they're doing pretty well, but when you actually show them the numbers, it's clear that they're not.'' St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, which calls itself ''the heart center'' and had consistently posted below-average death rates for coronary bypass operations on a state report card until 2002, was not in the top third of hospitals nationwide on any of the Hospital Compare measures. The hospital failed to deliver appropriate care 203 times out of 2,098 cases involving heart attack and heart failure patients.	0
Yet, with all this, including the clamor to retain and even expand that big government program -- Medicare -- we still can't envision getting to where we need to be because of our cynicism and distrust of government! John Schlager  Springfield, N.J., Jan. 1, 2007 To the Editor: Paul Krugman's appeal for universal health care is right on. While we suffer without the assurance of annual checkups, France, Canada, Scandinavia, Germany, Britain and others find it within their economic abilities to leave no person without annual medical exams and more. The principal reason for our haplessness is, as Mr. Krugman wrote, the lobbying power of insurance businesses. Just why their intrusion into the equation is tolerated is beyond logic. I never saw an insurance agent cure so much as a hangnail. Gil Weiss  Stamford, Conn., Jan. 1, 2007	0
We certainly aren't alone: according to the National Resident Matching Program, the organization that coordinates placement for postgraduate medical training, the number of primary care residency programs has dropped by more than a third over the past decade. And most of those remaining are now smaller. During the same period, the number of doctors applying for postgraduate training overall has increased. ''When students come to medical school, being somebody's doctor is really what they want to do. Somehow, by the time they leave, we've changed their minds; they'd rather do just about anything but that.'' That's the assessment of Dr. Allan Goroll, an early advocate of primary care training and the author of the most widely used textbook in primary care medicine. What happened? Why don't medical-school graduates want to be ''somebody's doctor'' anymore? And it's not just doctors: patients, even those with insurance, are voting with their feet, increasingly choosing to visit emergency rooms and specialists directly. Is this just the marketplace speaking? Or could it be that the idea of the personal physician is out of date and that the time has come to retire the picture of Marcus Welby?	0
For now, most patients in Russia and the other countries can receive ranolazine as part of large safety studies that follow the trials on the drug's effectiveness. But those studies will end, and Dr. Lange says he does not relish taking the drug away from people being helped by it. In the United States, patients who participate in clinical trials often continue to receive the drug being tested until it is approved. After that, they can buy it or, if they cannot afford it, apply to special programs that most companies offer to help people who could not otherwise get drugs they need. But with the exception of AIDS drugs, which companies provide free or at low cost to patients in poor countries, there is no industry consensus about what to do internationally, especially when drugs are not lifesaving. And even when companies market their drugs in poor countries, they tend not to set up a system to give the drugs away to study subjects after a clinical trial ends.	1
The F.D.A. is now rushing to put into effect a rule first proposed in late 1999, during Dr. Henney's tenure, that would allow data from animal studies to be used in place of human testing when it is impossible or unethical to do tests on patients. But the agency is reluctant to relax its standards too much. Even though the nation is now in the midst of an anthrax attack, the only manufacturer of anthrax vaccine, the Bioport Corporation of Lansing, Mich., has been unable to supply its product because its factory has failed F.D.A. safety inspections. Earlier this month, BioPort applied for another inspection, which could take place in coming weeks. Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said the agency had faced similar questions before. When patients with cancer and AIDS pushed for more access to experimental drugs, the F.D.A. adopted procedures to speed approval of drugs for life-threatening illnesses and allowed for some experimental drugs to be made available.	0
Placebos are still needed in clinical research, Dr. Hrobjartsson said, to prevent researchers from knowing who is getting a real treatment. Otherwise, he said, researchers can end up seeing what they want to see. For example, they may notice changes in patients who are taking an active drug while not paying as much attention to similar symptoms in patients that they know are being left untreated. Patients, he said, who are told they are not being treated may leave the study, further complicating research efforts. Dr. Hrobjartsson and Dr. Gotzsche said they began their study out of curiosity. Over and over, medical journals and textbooks asserted that placebo effects were so powerful that, on average, 35 percent of patients would improve simply if they were told that a dummy treatment was real. The investigators began asking where this assessment came from. Every paper, Dr. Hrobjartsson said, seemed to refer to other papers. And those papers referred him to other papers. He began peeling back the onion, finally coming to the original paper. It was written by a Boston doctor, Henry Beecher, who had been chief of anesthesiology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and in 1955 published a paper, ''The Powerful Placebo'' in The Journal of the American Medical Association.	1
Researchers at the University of Florida reported today that transplanting human embryonic or fetal 	0
''It's better than anything we had hoped for,'' said Dr. Dale Schenk,  Elan's vice president of neurobiology. ''We actually think the vaccine is stimulating the immune system to come in and take up the plaque.'' Dr. Ivan M. Lieberburg, senior vice president of research at Elan Pharmaceuticals, said the company was ''moving forward to clinical trials aggressively.'' The Elan researchers immunized the mice with a synthetic form of the beta-amyloid peptide, which is the predominant compound found in the plaques in patients' brains. They linked the peptide to an immune system stimulus, or adjuvant, that is commonly used in mouse studies. The adjuvant prompts the immune system to attack the amyloid plaques it would otherwise ignore. The adjuvant used in the mice is not tolerated by people, though the researchers said that designing one that was tolerated was not regarded as a major hurdle. The mice had been implanted with a mutated human gene that prompts the overproduction of amyloid, but that mutation is only found in a minority of actual Alzheimer's patients, those with so-called familial Alzheimer's, rather than the more common sporadic form. People with sporadic Alzheimer's do not overproduce amyloid, but instead seem to have a problem clearing it from the body. The only way to determine whether the vaccine is effective for them would be through clinical trials.	0
But is a mammogram -- a filmed image produced by extremely low-dose X-rays -- the best screening tool for everyone? It is certainly not perfect, as Dr. Berry would be the first to point out. According to studies cited by the National Cancer Institute, 10 to 20 percent of breast cancers detected by a physical exam were missed by a film mammogram. And even as Dr. Berry's new findings reinforce the traditional scan's overall value, some doctors have begun using other technologies -- digital mammography, ultrasound and M.R.I. scanning ( or, as some doctors call it, M.R.) -- to hunt for breast malignancies in some women. Are these other tests better? Not necessarily, according to Dr. Constance Lehman, a radiologist at the University of Washington, who is spearheading a large study of M.R.I.'s possible benefits for breast cancer patients. Recently, Dr. Lehman has also been fielding phone calls from healthy women seeking the new test, including some who want to bypass traditional mammography. She urges them not to make that mistake.	0
In a report of the work in today's issue of the journal Science, Dr. Alain Fischer, a professor of pediatric immunology at the Necker children's hospital in Paris, and his colleagues describe the course of two of the babies, 11 months and 8 months of age at the time of their treatment. Three months after the therapy, the researchers recounted, the babies were home, living like any other children. Ten months later, their immune systems were normal. Untreated infants born with SCID who are not kept in a sterile bubble become ill within months and die before their first birthday. In a footnote, the researchers say they have now successfully treated a third baby, who was a month old at the time. In a telephone interview, Dr. Fischer said yesterday that he had now treated two more babies and is waiting to learn whether the effort succeeded with them as well.	1
These patients were able to clear much of the Ebola out of their blood, then continued to produce both ''killer'' cells and interferon to suppress further multiplication of the  viruses. By contrast, the immune systems of the majority, those who did not survive the infection, failed to give a balanced defense  within the first two to three days after infection. They had a poor showing of antibodies, but at the same time apparently produced too much of the cellular kind of defense, as signaled by excessive production of interferon. One possibility is that the overly robust response of one part of the immune system may be giving falsely strong signals, thereby passing information that would suppress the other side of the defense. Or, possibly, the patient was infected by so much virus that it overwhelmed one half of the immune system's defenses. The lack of one kind of defense and excess of another suggests that a good strategy to attack Ebola infection may be to intervene in the body to balance the two kinds of defenses by enhancing one or depressing the other.	0
Several new breast cancer treatments may soon be available to lower a patient's risk of recurrence or simply be less invasive, less toxic and less burdensome than existing therapies. They are not miracle cures, but with cancer, treatment advances are typically small, adding up over time to make significant differences in patients' recovery. One advance that has generated excitement among oncologists is a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors, a type of hormone therapy. Some predict that these drugs could replace tamoxifen, the most common drug for preventing the recurrence of breast cancer. The aromatase inhibitors are now approved for use in menopausal women with advanced or metastatic cancer. At the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December, researchers presented results of a large study comparing anastrazole, an aromatase inhibitor, to tamoxifen. The study, involving more than 9,000 women who had breast cancer and had undergone surgery and chemotherapy (if needed), found a 17 percent reduction in the risk of recurrence in those taking the aromatase inhibitor compared with those taking tamoxifen.	0
''No one thought that chronic myelogenous leukemia and GIST had anything in common five years ago,'' said Dr. Jonathan W. Simons, director of the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. ''One floats in your blood and one is a nasty lump of tumor in your stomach lining.'' Herceptin, a breast cancer drug, homes in on a particular molecule found in overabundance on the surface of about 30 percent of breast tumors and is given only to women with that tumor profile. Similarly, several drug companies are developing drugs to block another molecule that spurs rapid cell growth called the epidermal growth factor receptor, or E.G.F.R. Such drugs may work on lung, colon and pancreatic tumors that have active receptors, but not on the lung, colon and pancreatic cancers that do not. Still, some experts say, scientists will never be able to ignore completely the site in the body the cancer started because the location also helps determine tumor behavior.	0
And the tall block buildings are now left standing; the children, now more hopeful, add fire escapes and hang paper ladders down the sides. Yet this hard-won progress is fragile. The impending end of the school year has brought new worries, about leaving friends, about going to camp, about returning next year to another September. And when the adults around them become anxious, unsettled by headlines about the possibility of dirty bombs, nuclear weapons or nerve gas in the subways, the clock abruptly spins backward. ''It has been increasingly clear,'' Ms. Switzer told a Congressional hearing on children's mental health needs in the wake of the terrorist attacks, held in New York last week, ''that merely wanting the normalcy of our lives and our feelings before Sept. 11 is not enough to make it happen.'' Many parents, seeking to reassure their children, to provide a bulwark against fear and uncertainty, have had similar thoughts over the last few weeks.	0
Even a treatment as venerable as progesterone, a hormone vital to a healthy pregnancy, is divisive. Some doctors swear that it helps. Others argue that it does nothing but postpone an inevitable miscarriage. New research suggests that very high doses of progesterone may be effective in some cases, probably a result of the hormone's immunosuppressive effects. ''How many patients do we save from miscarriage with progesterone supplements?'' Dr. Alan B. Copperman, director of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, asked. ''Not that many. Do we do it routinely? Sure we do. It's a mostly harmless, inexpensive treatment, which a lot of patients go on. But it probably doesn't save that many pregnancies.'' Dr. Kutteh said that when he was a student 15 years ago ''there was no training on pregnancy loss.'' ''It's just one of those areas where there wasn't much known,'' he added. ''And there were not many experts, and there was not a consensus on what to do.''	0
Of the new conclusion, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in an interview, ''This is the first time that the government is acknowledging that people got cancer from radiation exposure in the plants.'' The finding is detailed in a draft report prepared by officials of the Energy Department and the White House with the cooperation of a dozen government agencies. President Clinton ordered the study in July, when the Energy Department concluded that some workers at plants that had supplied beryllium to the government for bomb-making had developed beryllium disease, an incurable lung ailment. The president asked then for a broad study that would look at the effects of radiation and chemical hazards from uranium, plutonium and other substances. Mr. Clinton also asked the group to develop a policy on compensation, but that work has not been completed. Legislation proposed by Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, a Pennsylvania Democrat whose constituents include some of the beryllium disease patients, calls for payments to an estimated 500 to 1,000 former workers who either have the illness  or are at high risk of developing it. Under that bill, total payments in the beryllium cases could range from $15 million to $30 million a year, officials said.	0
But in recent years, steganog raphy has arrived on the Internet in a big way, experts said, with free and easy-to-use programs to insert messages into music or picture files. Many programs also allow users to choose an encryption scheme to further hide the message, so even if the recipients know it is there, they have to decode it to read it. ''In the past two years, the number of steganography tools available over the Internet has doubled -- it's 140 and growing,'' Dr. Johnson said. Some of the newer ones, he said, prompt users at each step on how to proceed. Bruce Schneier, a founder of Counterpane, an Internet security company, likened steganography to what is known as a dead drop -- a message, money or papers left in a hiding place to be picked up by someone. ''The effect is that the sender can transmit a message without ever communicating directly with the receiver,'' Mr. Schneier wrote in a recent newsletter. ''There is no e-mail between them, no remote log-ins, no instant messages. All that exists is a picture posted in a public forum, and then downloaded by anyone sufficiently enticed by the subject (both third parties and the intended receiver of the secret message.)''	1
Does the new détente represent a dangerous compromise or medical moderation? Some women's health advocates caution against rushing back to hormones. ''I would not argue with the idea that the Women's Health Initiative doesn't answer every last question we have about hormone therapy,'' said Amy Allina, program and policy director for the National Women's Health Network in Washington. ''I am concerned, though, that the medical community is resistant to accepting the implications of this research and worried that some women may be getting false reassurance.'' ''Many doctors have had a very hard time figuring out how the world looks now that they have these results,'' Ms. Allina said. ''So there's a tendency to fall back on the old ways, to find reasons why the findings shouldn't apply to their patients.'' Others see a sensible new equilibrium. ''Hormone therapy has lost its luster for the prevention of chronic diseases, but it will still be used for the treatment of hot flashes and other symptoms, and I think short-term use will become nearly as frequent as before,'' said Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and a principal investigator of the Women's Health Inititative. ''I don't think the pendulum will swing back entirely, but I think it will be used more often than it had been after the first trial.''	0
Doctors sometimes dismiss stress-related complaints as ''all in the patient's head.'' In a sense, they are right. The brain, specifically the amygdala, detects the first signs of danger, as demonstrated in now-classic studies by Dr. Joseph LeDoux of New York University. Other brain areas evaluate the threat's importance, decide how to respond and remember when and where the danger occurred, increasing the chances of avoiding it next time. So it is not surprising that when the stress system is derailed, the brain is a target for damage. A decade of research has demonstrated that sustained stress and the resulting overproduction of cortisol can have chilling effects on the hippocampus, a horseshoe-shaped brain structure intimately involved in memory formation. Scientists say they believe that the hippocampus plays an active role in registering not only events, but also their context, an important task in the face of danger. In stressful situations, the hippocampus also helps turn off the stress response after the threat has subsided.	0
Defibrillators, like the one Vice President Dick Cheney has, are beeper-size devices that monitor the heartbeat and apply an electrical shock if the rhythm degenerates into something dangerous. Sudden arrhythmias are common in patients like Mr. Cheney who have suffered moderate or severe heart attacks, and the irregularities can cause sudden death. Defibrillators can clearly reduce these deaths, and it is estimated that millions of Americans could potentially qualify for the $30,000 devices. But the cardiology fellow who presented the case wondered how hard he should push for his patient to get one, given his age and mental state. It makes sense to implant a device in the chest of a 50-year-old with a good life who is providing to society, the fellow said, but what about a 70-year-old debilitated by heart failure and living in a nursing home? That patient might benefit the most, he added, but would also have the least to offer society in terms of productive years.	0
Patients are beginning to get the message. Last week, Carole Dengel carried her 2-year-old daughter, Corie, out of Hackensack University Medical Center, where she had taken her a week before when she fell into a diabetic coma. Ms. Dengel, who sometimes volunteers with a New Jersey ambulance service, said she never felt the need to take her daughter out of state. ''When I bring somebody here, I know they'll be taken care of,'' she said. Doctors have already got the message. In the last few years, Dr. Devinsky said, he has been courted by a handful of New Jersey hospital systems. He never saw a reason to split his time. ''But St. Barnabas said that they wanted to take the lead in this area,'' he explained, ''and they said they were going to commit the resources to prove it.'' About eight miles south of St. Barnabas, Dr. Michael Gruber, a prominent brain tumor specialist who practices at New York University, is doing much the same thing. In May, he started working one day a week at Overlook Hospital in Summit, where the brand-new Brain Tumor Center of New Jersey -- part of a $15 million neurosciences research center -- has been built around him by the hospital's parent, Atlantic Health System. The system also recruited one of Dr. Gruber's colleagues at New York University, Dr. Kim Nelson, a neurological specialist.	0
People who inherit common variants of two genes have 10 times the risk of developing congestive heart failure, a condition that afflicts five million Americans, researchers say. Congestive heart failure is a leading cause of death in the nation, but the researchers say their findings may help doctors identify drugs that are most likely to help patients and to find people at high risk early enough to arrest the disease. In a paper published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers at the University of Cincinnati proposed that the gene variants might predispose people to the disease. The researchers looked at 159 patients with congestive heart failure, comparing them with 189 people who were similar in other respects, including race, but who did not have the disease. They discovered that their suspicions about the genes were correct. Other experts said the results were among the first soundings of a new era in medicine in which doctors identify an individual's genetic variations to help him avoid illness.	1
But he said the Acambis vaccine, while produced with more modern methods than the existing vaccine, would not be much safer because it used the same strain of virus. He added that its risks would be acceptable if there were a bioterror attack, but that in the absence of an attack, ''it's certainly likely that the adverse events will outweigh any risks from smallpox.'' Dr. Gordon's comments raise the question of whether the government should have considered the Japanese vaccine when it decided to build its stockpile. But government officials say they had to go with what had been proved to work. ''We had to build the stockpile based on proven efficacy and proven acceptability to the F.D.A.,'' said Dr. Philip Russell, special adviser on bioterrorism vaccines in the Department of Health and Human Services. Acambis declined to comment. Dr. Russell said that since the Japanese vaccine had been developed after smallpox was eradicated in Japan, ''there's no historical proof that it works.'' He also said the vaccine was made in an unusual type of cell culture that might not pass muster with the drug agency.	0
Dr. Goldfarb, who plans to phase his new practice, said that analyzing the results of the physical and helping patients develop priorities and goals formed the core of his philosophy. In addition to taking detailed medical histories, he said, he also emphasizes nutrition, exercise and what he called ''prophylactic medicine.'' Some critics contend that an emphasis on annual physical exams is misguided. Since 1989, the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, has issued a series of reports questioning the validity of annual check-ups. The reports warned that exams sometimes produced false alarms, subjecting healthy patients to unnecessary tests and discomfort. Dr. Goldfarb said he thought the annual check-up was a good idea. ''The value of the annual exam may be not be tangible in the sense of 'We're going to find it before you get it,''' he said, meaning discovering a problem before symptoms appear. ''But the relationship you as a doctor create with your patient is worth it on a variety of levels.''	0
''I have been given that precious second chance,'' she said. ''I was so blessed.''

They are expensive -- together, they account for 25 percent of the nation's annual health care expenditures, said Jonathan Skinner, a health economist at Dartmouth College.	???
The question was why. It could be, as some cardiologists argued, that Vioxx caused heart attacks. Or it could be, as Merck argued, that Vioxx was neutral, while naproxen actually reduced the likelihood of a heart attack. In April 2002, at the request of the Food and Drug Administration, Merck added the study's finding about heart attack risk to the drug's label. Several other studies followed. One looked at a million Medicaid patients; another at 1.4 million patients enrolled in Kaiser Permanente's health care plans; another at more than 50,000 Medicare patients. Each found more heart attacks and strokes with Vioxx, but medical experts differed over how to interpret the data. Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, writing in medical journals, argued vehemently that Vioxx and others in its class were not worth taking. He said they had ''marginal efficiency, heightened risk, and excessive cost'' compared with drugs like aspirin.	1
Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research at the University of Minnesota, was on a committee at Johns Hopkins that recommended Cipro because, he said, ''as a fluoroquinoline, it was the drug we have the best data for.'' But, like Dr. Fauci, he expected that other drugs in the class could be about equally effective. The Johns Hopkins group wrote in its report that still other antibiotics were effective against anthrax bacteria in the laboratory, including ''chloramphenicol, erythromycin, clindamycin, extended-spectrum penicillins, macrolides, aminoglycosides, vancomycin hydrochloride, cefazolin and other first-generation cephalosporins.'' Dr. Osterholm worried, however, about encouraging the public to seek out the other drugs. ''If we talk about this in public, we'll just see runs on other antibiotics,'' he said. ''You just give the public the sense that, 'Hey, if I can't get Cipro I'll get doxy, and if I can't get doxy, I'll get penicillin.' ''	1
SCIENCE has always fascinated me. As a child in Tibet, I was keenly curious about how things worked. When I got a toy I would play with it a bit, then take it apart to see how it was put together. As I became older, I applied the same scrutiny to a movie projector and an antique automobile. At one point I became particularly intrigued by an old telescope, with which I would study the heavens. One night while looking at the moon I realized that there were shadows on its surface. I corralled my two main tutors to show them, because this was contrary to the ancient version of cosmology I had been taught, which held that the moon was a heavenly body that emitted its own light. But through my telescope the moon was clearly just a barren rock, pocked with craters. If the author of that fourth-century treatise were writing today, I'm sure he would write the chapter on cosmology differently.	0
Moreover, the low-volume doctors were not accumulating enough data to show if they were good. So he simply assumed they were not, and restricted them to other radiology tasks, like CAT scans. How did they feel? Rather relieved, it turns out. Dr. John A. Siebert, for one, says mammography was monotonous, particularly since he might screen 200 healthy women before finding one cancer. An instructor once told him to pretend that each X-ray was his mother's, but that trick, he says, went only so far. ''It's sort of tedious,'' he says. ''You have to sort of slap yourself to look at them.'' Others say they had trouble mustering -- and holding onto -- the intense yet relaxed concentration needed to find the more subtle tumors, what some of the Denver doctors call ''the Zen zone.'' ''It was hard for me to get in the groove,'' Dr. John W. Grudis says.	0
''There are always people looking for a new recreational stimulant, and this can give you a major rush,'' Mr. Merritt said of DHEA. John Maglio, a personal trainer at Gold's Gym in downtown Brooklyn, said he had taken 150 milligrams of DHEA a day, with no negative side effects. But he would not recommend it to women, he said. Without new controls on alternative medicines, doctors and fitness trainers said, more and more people will be hurt by them. ''Health food stores do billions of dollars of business based on rumor and hope,'' said Dr. Millman, referring to DHEA. ''No one has proven that it is an aphrodisiac. No one has shown that it improves testosterone levels. No one has shown that it increases muscle mass. But people take it because it is rumored to have those effects.''	0
Two of Pfizer's most vocal critics, Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a pediatrician at Boston Medical Center, and Dr. Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen, the consumer group, have complained about Pfizer's Zithromax campaign to Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services. The two doctors had obtained an internal Pfizer document that listed a toll-free phone number for pediatricians to call if they wondered whether to prescribe Zithromax to children. When they called, they heard recorded advice from Dr. Russell Steele, vice chairman of pediatrics at Louisiana State University's school of medicine. He said, among other things, that most children's ear infections would be cured with a drug like Zithromax. The Pfizer internal document said the purpose of the recorded advice was to ''counter'' recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that were published in early 1999. Those guidelines said other antibiotics were more effective than Zithromax at curing children's ear infections.	0
Dr. Marburger said he was unconvinced by the report's description of those incidents. ''I don't think it makes the case for the sweeping accusations that it makes,'' he said. But Dr. Sidney Drell, an emeritus professor of physics at Stanford and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution who was not a signatory to the statement, said the overall findings rang true to him. ''I am concerned that the scientific advice coming into this administration seems to me very narrow,'' said Dr. Drell, who has advised the government on issues of national security for some 40 years and has served in Democratic and Republican administrations, including those of Presidents Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson. ''The input from individuals whose views are not in the main line of their policy don't seem to be sought or welcomed,'' he said.	0
The program was put together by José E. Serrano, the Bronx representative who helped arrange $2.3 million in federal financing last year, and $2.6 million this year, from the Departments of Defense, State and Education. Columbia officials said they had also begun to think about how to raise private money to help support the program, although they could not predict how many students would participate once it was was fully under way. Mr. Serrano said he hoped that with proper training, students like those at Hostos could begin to give American foreign policy a new face. ''When I got to Congress in 1990, I began to see that a lot of my questions about foreign policy did not get satisfactory answers,'' he said yesterday. ''It dawned on me that the people who make foreign policy are good people, but there is a lack of females and minorities and Hispanics. So it came to me that maybe, just maybe, we could change some of that.''	0
Symptoms include nausea and vomiting, muscle weakness, headache and disorientation, as well as bloating and puffiness in the face and fingers. In the last year or so, a dozen marathon runners in this country were known or suspected of having hyponatremia, said Dr. William Roberts, a spokesman for the American College of Sports Medicine, the professional organization of sports physicians. One victim was a 43-year-old woman who died after running the Chicago Marathon last fall. Doctors are looking for hyponatremia more now than ever before, but they say that increased vigilance does not fully explain the increased diagnoses. Another reason may be that many recreational athletes are drinking too much water. ''We've done a good job of educating people on proper rehydration, but some people have taken that to the nth degree, thinking that the more you drink, the better,'' Dr. Sawka said. Doctors say that most of the marathon runners with hyponatremia were relatively inexperienced athletes who entered races to raise money for charity. ''They're the ones who are in the race for a long time, and there's some speculation that they're drinking too much water during the race,'' Dr. Roberts said.	0
One of the most closely watched weight-loss treatments in late-stage clinical trials is Acomplia, made by Sanofi-Aventis, based in Paris. It works by blocking the same pleasure receptor in the brain that responds to the effects of marijuana. Test patients who took the drug for two years lost an average of 16 pounds, the company said. Sanofi-Aventis is expected to seek Food and Drug Administration approval for Acomplia by this summer. Other approaches include a weight-loss nasal spray that a biotechnology company, Nastech Pharmaceutical, is testing in partnership with Merck. The spray contains a synthetic version of a human protein that signals a person's brain to stop eating when food reaches the intestines. ''Cures'' for fat, of course, have long been staples of the herbal supplement and over-the-counter medicine businesses, as well as the diet industry. Amphetamines were widely used as diet pills in the 1950's and 1960's, before physicians recognized their addictive effects. More recently, amphetamine-like substances have been sold as over-the-counter treatments.	???
Last year, a 10-month-old baby boy died in the hospital after a minor operation went wrong. The baby's parents, an American couple, had two other children and probably could have had another if they wished; neither parent was infertile, and both were healthy and in their 30's. But they did not want another child. They wanted this child. And before long, they began to believe that the longing they felt was telling them something quite specific -- that their dead baby's genes were crying out, as a ghost might, to express themselves again in this world. The idea preoccupied them that their little son's genotype deserved another chance, that it had disappeared by mistake and could be brought back by intention. Now if all this had happened, say, five years ago, their conviction might have soon faded away. The couple might have told their friends or family about this secret dream of resurrecting their baby's genes, and been talked out of it, or comforted in some other way. But it happened last year -- four years into the cloning revolution sparked by Dolly the sheep, at a moment when optimism about the miracles of biotech was running high and when it was not at all hard to find other people who shared a kind of metaphysical faith in the power of genes. One such group, a science-loving, alien-fixated religious movement called the Ralians, for whom cloning is a central tenet, was particularly eager to put its faith into action. Last June, the grieving couple and the Ralians found one another (on the Internet, of course) with results that could -- and should -- reopen the whole debate over whether human beings ought ever to be cloned, and for what purpose.	0
A drug once viewed as a possible magic bullet against obesity was rejected yesterday by a federal advisory panel because of worries that it causes neurological and psychiatric problems and increases the risk of suicide. Although the drug, rimonabant, is already marketed in 37 countries, it is now unlikely that the Food and Drug Administration will approve its sale in the United States without additional safety data. The advisory panel voted unanimously, 14 to 0, against recommending the drug, saying there was inadequate evidence of its safety. The F.D.A. is not required to follow the advice of such panels, but it typically does. The panel's vote was a blow to Sanofi-Aventis, the French company that makes the drug, which is sold in many countries under the brand name Acomplia. As the advisory committee finished voting, the company's stock, which trades in this country as American depositary receipts, closed at $43.07, down $1.31 or 2.95 percent. It fell another $1.02 in after-hours trading.	0
And there are good, even philosophically sound, reasons for this. ''It is an almost universal conviction that abortion becomes steadily more problematic morally as a fetus develops toward infanthood,'' writes the legal scholar Ronald Dworkin, ''as the difference between pregnancy and infancy becomes more a matter of the baby's location than of its development.'' If you accept Dworkin's general argument that fetal life is a rapidly progressing continuum and that the more babylike an aborted fetus, the greater the insult to the sanctity of human life, then even in the first trimester earlier abortion is more acceptable. So, for example, while 88 percent of abortions are performed in the first trimester, 34 percent of those now occur between 9 and 12 weeks, by which time the developing life is considered a fetus, not an embryo. If medical abortions -- or even manual vacuum aspirations -- become more common, then many of those abortions could happen in the three- to eight-week range instead.	0
Those symptoms, he noted, involve the prefrontal cortex, a brain area not highly developed in animals. So, he asked, ''How do you model it in an animal?'' In one popular test, mice are placed in a pool of water and monitored to see how long they swim before giving up. If they are treated with an antidepressant, they swim longer. Another experiment involves hanging mice by their tails; those given antidepressants struggle longer before giving up. In a third test, mice are taught to avoid an electrical shock by pushing a lever. When the lever is inactivated, the mice continue to push it anyway, even though they still get shocked. Mice under the influence of antidepressants keep pushing it longer. But Dr. Robert R. Ruffolo, president of research and development at Wyeth, said it was a mistake to assume that an animal test can reflect human behavior. ''The first thing we do -- and this is tough -- is we don't try to relate the behavior in an animal to a human behavior,'' he said. Animals like mice, he added, ''don't feel happy or sad.''	1
The experiment is an effort by Medicare to address a fundamental concern about the current payment system. Hospitals are not paid more when they help keep a heart-failure patient from coming back to the hospital, for example. The hospitals participating in this experiment are being measured on whether they give patients clear instructions when they leave on how best to stay healthy. Medicare officials say they are encouraged by the program's results so far in supporting a move to a system that ties payments more closely to quality care. ''What we see is a good trend here,'' Mr. Kuhn said. Others agree that the experiment supports the idea of rewarding good care. ''I think it offers a lot of encouragement for the potential of linking even small amounts of pay to the reliability of care,'' said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, the president and chief executive of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a nonprofit group based in Cambridge, Mass.	0
On an airplane traveling to the meeting, Dr. Haskell pulled out his data and showed them to Dr. Fox. ''We drew a line through the points and I said, 'Gee, if you extrapolate that out it looks like at age 20, the heart rate maximum is 200 and at age 40 it's 180 and at age 60 it's 160,'' Dr. Haskell said. At that point, Dr. Fox suggested a formula: maximum heart rate equals 220 minus age. But, exercise physiologists said, these data, like virtually all exercise data, had limitations. They relied on volunteers who most likely were not representative of the general population. ''It's whoever came in the door,'' Dr. Kirkendall said. In addition, he and others said, gauging maximum heart rates for people who are not used to exercising is often difficult because many prematurely stop the test. As the treadmill hills get steeper, people who are not used to exercise will notice that their calves are aching. ''They will say they can't go any further,'' Dr. Kirkendall said.	1
The most important thing for this position is the medical background. It will come down to him to say, ''Is this drug ready to go to the public?''; to know the medical use of those devices, those drugs, firsthand; the risk-benefit ratio that you learn about in medical school; knowing that medicines can be life-saving but they can also be harmful. Those really have to weigh heavily on the person making those decisions. Q. How will Dr. McClellan's strength in economics and health policy help him? A. The agency in the past has operated very much in isolation, but Secretary Thompson [Tommy G. Thompson, secretary of health and human services] has expressed interest in having the agency be more a member of the team that addresses the needs of the health of the public. The prescription drug benefit discussions -- the commissioner will probably not play a role in those decisions, but by being a spokesperson for the agency, it will help inform the economic decisions that have to take place. And vice versa. If the agency is going to review a drug that will be covered by Medicare, it's going to be exposed to elderly patients in large numbers very quickly, and that has to be part of the safety plan.	0
But my friends and I talk about the risk a lot. We can get really philosophical that more of us are going to die from heart disease, but the truth is, we still worry, and all of us are going to wonder if we made the  right decision if we get breast cancer. The way I've dealt with it is to step back and look at the whole picture. I've concluded that my quality of life is so good I'm not willing to give that up for what may be in the future. Instead, I try to get mammograms regularly, do monthly self-examination -- and stay on top of the literature. Correction:  September 8, 2000, Friday  Credits in Science Times on Tuesday for two pictures of women with an article about views of hormone replacement therapy misspelled the surname of a photographer.

Internet searching was at the forefront of the technologies that Microsoft displayed on Tuesday at an event intended to showcase the company's research prowess. Despite a lack of visible progress in catching up with Google, the leader in Internet search engines, Microsoft says it still believes that it will eventually turn the tables by improving the quality of its search results and by changing the way computer users search. It is all part of an arms race for search supremacy that has engaged top researchers at both companies. During a morning session for more than 300 visitors at the Microsoft Conference Center, Lili Cheng, a user-interface designer for the Windows Vista operating system, showed off a new service called Mix that will allow Web surfers to organize search results and easily share them. Ms. Cheng, a Microsoft researcher trained as an architect, has moved back and forth between research and product development positions at the company. She said Mix would be released in six to nine months.	0
Doctors and hospitals across the country are scrambling to satisfy the booming demand for surgery that shrinks the stomachs of severely obese people. Dozens of hospitals are adding special operating suites for the procedure, called bariatric surgery, which attracted wide notice after public figures like Al Roker of ''Today'' on NBC, Sharon Osbourne of ''The Osbournes'' on MTV and Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat, had it done. Some bariatric surgeons are fully scheduled 12 months in advance, and hundreds of doctors have jumped into the field recently and started to advertise their availability. Bariatric procedures -- meant for obese people who are at extremely high risk of severe health problems, as defined by a National Institutes of Health consensus -- surged more than 40 percent last year, to 80,000. This year, the number is expected to climb to 120,000, according to Frost &amp; Sullivan, a consulting firm. Spending on bariatrics is approaching $3 billion a year, at an average cost of $25,000 for each procedure.	???
Dr. Goodall, 66, her trademark ponytail mostly gray, visits Gombe briefly these days. Mostly she is on the road, lecturing and raising money to operate the programs and building an endowment for the Jane Goodall Institute. She has engagements scheduled through 2004, and has spent no more than three weeks in one place for the last 14 years. In New York this month, toward the end of an American tour, she talked about her advocacy for what she calls the animal nation. Q.  Why have you transferred your energies  from animal research to activism? A.  I feel a desperation to make people see what we are doing to the environment, what a mess we are making of our world. At this point, the more people I reach, the more I  accomplish. It is exhausting, the hotels,  suitcases and airplanes, and I miss Gombe and my wonderful years in the forest. But if I were to go back to that, I wouldn't feel I was doing what I should be doing.	0
And so, he said, when academic researchers inquired about getting F.D.A. approval for their studies with human subjects, ''we almost discouraged them'' from applying. But the time, expense and trouble it would take for academics to submit their research proposals and for the F.D.A. to review them are no excuse to let them slip by, said Dr. Spilker of the pharmaceutical manufacturers group. ''You have to consider benefit-risk issues,'' he said. ''The risk is far too great. That's why we have standards.'' If someone had asked him about agreeing to inhale a gram of hexamethonium in a study that had not been approved by the F.D.A., Dr. Spilker said, he would have told them to refuse. ''I would never want anyone to go into a study like that, never.''	1
The race to decipher the human genome  has been, some say, a race to the starting line, not an end in itself. The contestants will have compiled, in one scientist's analogy, a genetic dictionary filled with letters and words, most of which have not  yet been given any meanings. Identifying what proteins the genes produce and how those proteins generate their effects in the body will be far harder than simply deciphering the genome. Eminent biologists describe it as a quest that will occupy their discipline for at least the next 50 years, if not the next century.	0
''Who's going to come and get me, and for what?'' Dr. Wenner asked. ''I'm listening to these people and evaluating their complaints, and I've got three file drawers with their charts.'' Three states outside the Ninth Circuit -- Colorado, Maine and Maryland -- have some form of medical marijuana law. Although the ruling is not strictly binding outside the Ninth Circuit, advocates for medical marijuana predict that it will strongly influence authorities elsewhere, especially given the Supreme Court decision to let it stand. ''Frankly, lawyers are ready to pounce on the government as soon as they start harassing doctors anywhere outside the Ninth Circuit,'' said Daniel Abrahamson, a lawyer for the plaintiffs who is legal affairs director of the Drug Policy Alliance. Federal officials have promised to continue enforcing the drug laws, reiterating their view that Marinol, an oral prescription drug that includes a form of THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, precludes the need for using marijuana itself as a medication.	0
Still, Dr. West said it might be possible one day to produce human babies through parthenogenesis.  Male parthenotes could be created, too, he said, by replacing the DNA in an egg with the DNA from two of a male's sperm cells. But male and female parthenotes have shown differences, said Dr. Jose Cibelli, vice president for research at Advanced Cell Technology. Stem cells derived from male par thenotes tend to turn into muscle cells, while stem cells from female parthenotes turned more often into brain and nerve cells, he said. Dr. West said that if this process could be used to produce live offspring it would open up vast new reproductive possibilities. A woman could give birth by herself. Or two men may be able to each contribute one sperm to have a baby together.	0
One bright spot of the research so far is that the SARS virus grows well in cultures of cells derived from monkey kidneys. That makes studying the virus easier. Having an animal that becomes infected by the virus would also be useful for testing drugs and vaccines, so federal researchers are trying to determine whether they can infect animals like mice or monkeys. Some experts say that is not likely because coronaviruses tend to infect only one species. The rat coronavirus does not even infect mice, said Dr. Kathryn V. Holmes of the University of Colorado, an authority on the viruses. Moreover, the freshly deciphered genetic sequence of the SARS virus shows that it is not very similar to other known coronaviruses. As for treatments, doctors in Hong Kong, a center of the outbreak, reported last week in the The Lancet that the combination of steroids and the antiviral drug ribavirin appeared to help. But the Army biodefense lab found in its tests that ribavirin did not inhibit the replication of the SARS virus grown in the laboratory. And a spate of new deaths over the weekend in Hong Kong has dimmed enthusiasm for the treatment even there.	0
While it is not uncommon for a few cancer cells to develop when men are in their 20's or 30's, these cells typically divide so slowly that tumors are rare in men younger than 50. After that, prostate cancer becomes increasingly common: men in their 60's and 70's have a 1-in-6 chance of being diagnosed with prostate cancer; a man living to 100 is almost certain to develop it. But again, given prostate cancer's languid growth, most older men will die of other causes, like heart disease or stroke. Hence the adage that most prostate cancer patients die with their disease rather than from it. Moreover, the P.S.A. test cannot pinpoint those faster growing tumors for which early treatment might make a difference. Still, the P.S.A. continues to have strong advocates, not the least of whom are patients who have had surgery and never experienced a recurrence. They are usually convinced that P.S.A. testing has prolonged their lives, if not saved them. Indeed, in some cases the test may have done just that.	0
Yet a 1997 study, published in Cancer, the journal of the American Cancer Society, found that African-American women treated for breast cancer at United States military hospitals, where equal medical access is mandated, had a 41 percent greater risk of death than their white counterparts receiving the same care. According to Dr. Barbara E. Wojcik, an Army statistician and co-author of the study, early screening may play a role. In a small follow-up study, she found that, compared with whites and Hispanics, a smaller percentage of the black women had received diagnoses of breast cancer through mammography. Among those whose breast cancers were detected by mammograms, there were no differences in survival rates. Diet and body weight may also play a role. Most of the women in the military study were civilian spouses, not subject to the Army's physical requirements. On average, Dr. Brawley said, black women are heavier and have denser breast tissue than whites, increasing both their chances of breast cancer and the difficulty of detecting it on a mammogram. Overweight white women also appear to have a higher incidence of breast cancer than white women of normal weight.	0
Dr. Lipton added that, as a computer scientist, he appreciated the proof that the code could not be broken. ''Michael's big contribution has been the proof that the system actually works,'' he said. ''It's one of those things that sounds obvious but the mathematics is quite hard.'' Of course, what is good for those who want privacy may not be good for law enforcement. Even the cryptography systems sold today are a problem for the F.B.I. ''Uncrackable encryption allows drug lords, terrorists and even violent gangs to communicate about their criminal intentions without fear of outside intrusion,'' the F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh, told the Senate in 1998, according to a transcript from the Federal Document Clearing House. ''This type of encryption also allows these same people to maintain electronically stored evidence of their crimes beyond the reach of law enforcement.'' Still, some computer experts said that while it might be interesting in theory to have a provably unbreakable code, the practical importance of Dr. Rabin's code may be minimal.	1
Dr. Michael West, chief executive of Advanced Cell Technology, would not comment when asked if the company had tried this in humans. He also would not discuss the company's work in detail, saying he did not want to jeopardize an upcoming publication in a scientific journal. The work takes advantage of a phenomenon known as parthenogenesis. It is known that some species of flowers, insects, lizards and snakes can reproduce asexually, with the female's egg growing into a baby without being fertilized by a male.. Parthenogenesis, which is from the Greek for virgin birth, does not occur naturally in mammals. But for decades scientists have known how to trick the eggs of mice, rabbits and other mammals into developing as if they had been fertilized by subjecting the eggs to various chemicals or to temperature changes, needle pricks or electrical shocks. The resulting embryos are called parthenotes. It has not been reported that this has ever been done with human eggs, however, and it would raise ethical questions.	0

For most of the 20th century, doctors thought of blood vessels as a simple network of pipes -- a plumbing system that could become clogged by the accumulation of cholesterol. ''It was really a hydraulic, nonbiological view,'' said Dr. Peter Libby, chief of cardiovascular medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital. According to this view, if cholesterol deposits grew too large, there would not be enough room left for blood to flow, and the patient would begin to feel chest pains. If a coronary artery became entirely plugged, the person would suffer a heart attack. But severe blockages, it turns out, cause at most three out of 10 heart attacks. The rest occur in people whose blood is flowing freely, through arteries narrowed by less than half their capacity. These lesser blockages are usually found in people who die of heart attacks relatively young, in their 40's or 50's. For these deaths, doctors needed a new explanation.	0
If muscles are stronger, Dr. Franklin said, a person's heart rate and blood pressure response will be lower, creating less demand on the heart when something is lifted. ''It's not how heavy the load is,'' he said.  ''It's how heavy relative to how strong the muscles are that results in the rise in heart rate and blood pressure.'' The panel concluded that weight training did not cause complications in healthy adults or people with minor damage to their hearts. But the results were unclear for moderate or high-risk heart patients. For instance, the researchers did not recommend lifting weights if patients had unstable angina, uncontrolled high blood pressure, uncontrolled arrhythmia, or were suffering from heart failure. They also recommended that cardiac patients with low to moderate risks first participate in aerobic exercise programs for at least two to four weeks. At 84, Ken Bateman of Birmingham, Mich., participates in the cardiac rehabilitation program that Dr. Franklin directs at Beaumont Hospital. ''You have to keep the body functioning to keep the heart functioning,'' said Mr. Bateman, who had a heart attack 14 years ago.	0
The news that thousands of women in a national study were suddenly being taken off hormone replacement therapy ushered in a day of reckoning for the millions of other women who take hormones. They all had the same simple but vexing question: Should I quit, too? As their doctors scrambled for answers, a consensus of sorts seemed to emerge, in which hormone users were divided into two categories: women who had taken them only a year or two to treat hot flashes and other temporary symptoms of menopause and those who had taken them for years. In the short-term, doctors said, hormone replacement therapy still seems safe. But it does not look as promising as it once did for a woman's long-term health. ''If a woman has only been taking hormones for a year or two to treat hot flashes,'' said Dr. Lori Mosca, director of preventive cardiology at New York Presbyterian Hospital, ''it's probably safe for her to go on. But if she's been on hormones for 10 years, it's time to stop.''	0
''That just came unexpectedly,'' Dr. Richmond said, ''and we are still not sure of all the factors that contributed to it.'' A disappointment among the data is that while infant mortality has continued to decline, and is almost at the goal, there remains a great disparity between the rate for whites and for blacks. The death rate among black infants is about twice that for whites, Dr. Richmond said. ''and has been that way for decades.'' Dr. Satcher said other health disparities among ethnic groups were also troubling. Hispanics are twice as likely as whites to be diabetic and African-Americans have a disproportionately high death rate from diabetes. African-Americans are also much more likely than whites to be hospitalized or die from asthma. Dr. Satcher also noted that some of the most important challenges were in diet and fitness. For example, he said, the percentage of overweight Americans was about 26 in the mid-1970's. The Government established a goal of 20 percent of the population for the year 2000, and many people believed that it might be achieved as more Americans appeared to become interested in nutrition and fitness over the past 15 years. But instead, the number of people overweight rose to 35 percent by 1995, the latest year for which data was given in the report.	0
Two Seoul newspapers reported that angry viewers had posted photos of family members of the show's producers on the Internet, threatening to kill them. To many, the backlash reflects a growing tendency in the country to invoke nationalistic sentiments to resist outside scrutiny. On Saturday, President Roh Moo Hyun posted a statement on his Web site saying that ''the public's response went too far.'' But hours after his message, about 50 people started a candlelight vigil in front of the MBC studios. ''I want to stand up and walk again,'' Kang Won Rae, a pop singer who has been in a wheelchair since a car accident. ''Dr. Hwang is the biggest hope for us disabled people.'' He said Dr. Hwang ''is being victimized excessively for his minor ethical breaches in the past.'' Some critical voices have been heard, often on the left, saying South Korea had invited problems by encouraging Dr. Hwang's headlong dash into stem cell research while hardly taking note of the ethical debates over the research in countries like the United States.	0
Nevertheless, Dr. Caldwell and other Lymerix supporters believe even a little protection now is better than none at all. None of the vaccine's inconveniences -- three injections over the course of a year, sore arms after the shots, less than complete immunity and uncertainty over how long the immunization lasts -- puts off patients as much as the cost, which varies widely. SmithKline charges $49 a dose. But some doctors are billing up to $100, to cover office time and counseling. Other doctors say they are not being properly reimbursed by health insurance companies, so they write prescriptions for Lymerix that the patient must fill at a pharmacy (which charges what it likes) and then return to the doctor's office to take the medication. Many doctors said they had decided to inoculate themselves and their families -- some on an accelerated schedule, despite the F.D.A's recommendations. Dr. Vijay K. Sikand of East Lyme, Conn., has vaccinated himself and his wife and enrolled his children in a study of Lymerix. (There are 4,000 children between 4 and 18 in the trial, and Dr. Sikand said the vaccine appears to be more effective for them than for adults.)	0
The new study on the falling breast cancer rates was reported Thursday at a breast cancer conference in San Antonio. The investigators, led by Donald A. Berry, a statistician at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, calculated that there were 14,000 fewer diagnoses of breast cancer when women stopped taking the drugs after July 2002. Prescriptions for Prempro, the most popular of the drugs, fell by half. A similar report, by Christina Clarke and colleagues at the Northern California Cancer Center, which looked at California data, found that the trend continued into 2004. Wyeth, the maker of Prempro, said in a statement yesterday that ''the potential impact of hormone therapy on breast cancer has long been warned in product labels.'' But the new data analysis, the company said, does not prove cause and effects. There were other possible reasons for the decline, Wyeth added. For now, the company said, ''caution and further examination over a longer period of time is advised before these data can be fully understood.''	1
For some people, cloning just seems like a chance to have a baby with some kind of genetic connection -- even if it's only to one parent, even if the connection is uncomfortably close, even if they're a little vague on what a clone is. Desiree Boen, one of the dozens of infertile people who have posted messages to the Human Cloning Foundation Web site seeking help, said she was ''really, really interested'' in trying to clone a baby. Boen, a 25-year-old teacher's aide and former nurse from Orlando, Fla., has two children, 9 and 6, but because of a hysterectomy she underwent a year ago, she can't have any more with her new husband. Unlike many infertile people intrigued by cloning, Boen tried to adopt -- but it was a private adoption, and ''the mom seemed so flaky and unsure that I backed out of it.'' She said she would consider having a baby with the help of a surrogate mother, ''except that you hear such bad stories about them changing their minds and keeping their babies.'' And because she lacks ovaries, Boen would need donor eggs as well. ''I have a niece who's 19, and she offered one of her eggs,'' she said in a phone conversation. ''But you know it gets pretty complicated when it's inside the family.'' When I asked if she would prefer to clone one of her cells or her husband's, Boen was puzzled, then admitted she thought ''you could use both.'' But after a moment, she said, ''Oh, I'd take my husband's, I guess.'' She said her husband was a great guy and she'd like him to have a boy just like him -- one whom he could enjoy ''in the cutesy phase.''	0
''We're not anywhere near the level of this happening in humans, and there are many roadblocks,'' Dr. Grabel said. ''But there are some models of the system that look very promising, and we're just at the very beginning. This is going to be far beyond what we were able to do before.'' Like other scientists pushing for such research, Dr. Grabel said she was thankful for the ''extremely supportive political climate'' in the state and said she expected other researchers to take notice. ''There is no question that more money is going to translate into more research, and we will be in an excellent position to get more dollars from the federal government if the funds ever become available,'' she said. While the financing is widely praised in scientific circles and many advocates view it as a potential boon for local economies, some caution that financial support from states alone could result in a patchwork and haphazard approach to the research.	0
Hospitals must meet federal standards as a condition of getting Medicare money, which accounts for about 40 percent of hospital revenue, on the average. Using this lever, the federal government sets detailed standards covering every aspect of hospital activity, from sanitation to fire safety to infection control. President Clinton's proposals, or something similar, seem likely to become reality for four reasons. The issue has great appeal to consumers, and this is an election year. The government already has the power to do much of what Mr. Clinton wants. Congress is eager to take action. And lawmakers have a convenient vehicle, the patients' bill of rights, now pending before a conference committee of House and Senate negotiators. White House documents say the Food and Drug Administration will develop standards to prevent errors caused by drug names that sound alike and packages that look alike. In addition, new labeling standards will require drug makers to highlight dangerous drug interactions and common dosage errors.	0

Besides, though cloned animals can be normal and healthy-appearing -- some cloned mice and cattle even seem ''improved,'' in the sense that they appear to age more slowly -- what's normal in a barnyard animal isn't all that high a standard. ''The fact that you can get a sheep or a mouse that looks normal,'' said Stuart Newman, a developmental biologist at New York Medical College, ''doesn't mean that some subtle things haven't gone wrong in brain development that you wouldn't necessarily notice in a sheep, but you would in a human. Yes, you can clone a mouse -- but can you take him to the opera?'' Cloned humans might show higher rates of cancer or other diseases, but we'd only find out by cloning them and waiting to see if disaster strikes. None of this means, however, that cloning services won't someday be marketed to desperate people -- or even that human cloning isn't going on somewhere right now. ''It's relatively easy to set up a lab and find someone competent to carry out the procedures,'' warned Roger Gosden, an infertility researcher at McGill University. ''Regrettably, we will probably wake up one day to the news that someone, somewhere, has used somatic-nuclear-transfer technology to produce a human clone.''	0
The group, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, issued its advice last week as part of a report on the recommended dietary allowances for nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins and fats, as well as for fiber, fatty acids and cholesterol. They wrote that they knew the number of calories that people burned in a day and they knew how many calories would be consumed if people followed their dietary advice. Sedentary people, they worried, would gain weight. That led them to conclude that people must do the exercise equivalent of an hour of brisk walking each day. The group wrote that ''30 minutes of regular activity is insufficient to maintain body weight in adults in the recommended body mass index range.'' So, it concluded, ''to prevent weight gain as well as to accrue additional weight-independent health benefits of physical activity, 60 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity (e.g. walking/jogging at 4 to 5 miles per hour) is recommended in addition to the activities required by a sedentary lifestyle.''	1
Testing officials said they were able to confirm the cheating by noting that the scores on certain questions had risen significantly the longer the question was in circulation. Dr. Beere reported the results of the investigation to deans at more than 1,000 graduate schools in a letter mailed late last week. Its contents were first described yesterday in an online edition of The Chronicle of Higher Education. In the letter, Dr. Beere, who is also the associate provost for graduate studies and outreach at Northern Kentucky University, said the board would work to ''restore the confidence and trust that you have in the scores from applicants in the affected regions.'' She also reminded her colleagues to view the scores of any applicant in the context of the entire application.	0
Others say the same. ''People think that the early detection of cancer is absolutely and unequivocally a good thing,'' said Dr. Robert J. Stanley, the head of the radiology department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. But even when a test detects cancer, the discovery may not be lifesaving. For example, Dr. Stanley said, 60 percent to 100 percent of thyroid glands in people over 60 have cells in them that a pathologist would call cancer. But, he said, fewer than 1 percent of older people ever develop symptoms of thyroid cancer. ''I believe in screening,'' said Dr. Andrew Wolf, associate professor of general internal medicine at the University of Virginia, who has studied what people understand about screening. ''But I think physicians as well as the public tend to overblow the risks of cancer. And, more important, we overblow the risk reduction conferred by screening.'' Dr. Wolf said that he offered women Pap tests and, for those over 50, mammograms. He also offers colon cancer screening tests to men and women over 50. But he said: ''I don't get bent out of shape when people refuse. We can operate on the margins by offering these cancer screens, but let's be honest about the expected impact.''	1
Dr. Sean Tunis, who directs the coverage and analysis group for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency that runs the programs, said that Medicare was likely to consider national coverage for the new use of implantable defibrillators. Medicare, he said, pays for technologies that are ''clinically effective.'' So far, cost has not been a factor in Medicare decisions, Dr. Tunis said, though Medicare is not legally prevented from considering it. But, he noted, Medicare's budget is fixed. ''As money for some particular service is increased, it may be that it causes a reduction in payments for other services,'' he said. ''It is not necessarily that the pie expands.'' Dr. Moss said that all 1,232 patients in the study had a heart-pumping function that was less than half of normal; they were also already being treated with the only drugs known to prolong their lives, beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, also known as ace inhibitors. But neither addressed the arrhythmia problem.	1
''The sad part is that the public looks to doctors for advice about this test, but the truth is, we don't have the information,'' said Dr. Gerald Chodak, the director of the Prostate and Urology Center at the University of Chicago's Louis A. Weiss Memorial Hospital. ''There are some potentially good things about screening and I'm not denying those. But there are also potentially bad things that are not insignificant. Right now, it's a totally individual sort of decision.'' When Nature Keeps Calling MEN bothered by their prostates may be able to enjoy better living through chemistry rather than surgery. A man's prostate gland typically begins enlarging in early middle age, a process known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or B.P.H. (''benign''  means the growth is not cancerous; ''hyperplasia'' means more cells than normal are present). The growing prostate may squeeze the urethra, the tube carrying urine from the bladder to the penis. The resulting symptoms include difficulty urinating, weakened flow and a frequent need to urinate, which can be especially annoying at night.	0
''It's time. You're over 50,'' my internist said casually during my routine physical in November. ''I'm sure you don't want to hear this, but you really should have a colonoscopy. Is there colon cancer in your family?'' ''Actually, there was,'' I answered. ''My maternal grandmother had it late in life.'' ''Then this is no longer elective,'' he added decisively. ''You have to do it.'' Great. Another invasive procedure. I already had multiple sclerosis, with my share of ordeals by procedure, steroid injections under my eyes and catheters snaked through arteries from my groin to my brain.  I didn't particularly want to participate in this next adventure. I just wanted to be indemnified against another disease. So now it would be the tush test. A television camera inserted into my rectum. The closer I came to the appointed hour with the gastroenterologist, the more I realized my utter horror was increasing and was out of proportion. What's wrong with this picture?	0
We sat down in the hotel restaurant, and Boisselier ordered a chicken Caesar salad and a decaf coffee. I don't know what I expected -- somebody spacier or in silver spandex, maybe. Boisselier was neither, and yet the conversation we had that day was deeply strange nonetheless. She said she had a lab up and running, ''not offshore, not in the Bahamas; somewhere in the United States.'' She wouldn't say where, except that it wasn't in one of the states that had outlawed cloning: ''I'm no fool.'' She had assembled a team of three -- a geneticist, a biochemist and an ob-gyn currently affiliated with an in-vitro fertilization clinic -- and she said that the first two were working on the project full time, experimenting with cattle cloning initially and then moving on to human cells sometime this winter. Was Boisselier worried about miscarriages or fetal abnormalities? ''We will monitor the developing embryo and the pregnancy very closely,'' she said calmly. ''We want a healthy baby.'' And she said that the surrogates who had volunteered to carry the cloned embryo -- one of whom is Boisselier's own 22-year-old daughter, Marina Cocolios -- were prepared to undergo abortions if defects were revealed by ultrasound or amniocentesis. If one pregnancy failed, another surrogate would automatically step into line; there would be no need to wait another month, as you would have to if you were dependent on the cycles of just one woman.	0
She has a 9-year-old son, and she said she felt she could not start again with a newborn child. This, too, is common. More than half of all women having abortions have had children, a percentage that rose in the 1980's but has not changed since 1990, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Karen and her boyfriend have an unstable relationship plagued by money problems, and they lived with a relative after being evicted from their home. She did not come in earlier in the pregnancy, she said, because she did not have the money. In the end, because she was so far along, her abortion took two days and cost $1,375, nearly three times what it would have cost if she had come in at 12 weeks. ''People tell you you can put your child up for adoption,'' she said. ''But if your kid has medical problems, no one wants to adopt him. And you never know.''	0
In one early finding, the department reported that women whose children suffered from leukemia drank more tap water than others. Almost every month for five years, researchers have presented their results to the public in the red oak-paneled meeting room of the Dover Township Municipal Building, where the Citizens Action Committee for the Childhood Cancer Cluster Investigation has gathered. Now, on Monday, all the pieces may finally come together. ''We will be asking two questions: Were the case children more likely to be exposed to water sources, or air pollution sources?'' Mr. Fagliano said. The state's congressional delegation and the families who took part will be the first to learn the answers. On Tuesday night, the public will be briefed at Toms River High School East. One of the more troubling questions may linger: will the study restore the community's faith in government? ''It's going to depend if they get results or not,'' Mrs. Gillick said. ''When you're talking lives of children, let's hope we get some real answers here.''	0
Dr. Eric D. Peterson, a cardiologist at Duke University who led a similar study with a national sample of patients, found that although there was less angioplasty on weekends, there was no difference in mortality rates. ''We couldn't prove that early catheterization was that key,'' Dr. Peterson said, using a term for same-day angioplasty. He added that the results might reflect findings from New Jersey at a time angioplasty for heart attack patients was being adopted. Dr. Mark A. Hlatky, a cardiologist and professor of health research and policy at Stanford University, doubted that the sole reason for extra weekend deaths was less aggressive care. ''There is more going on,'' Dr. Hlatky said. The weekend effect shows up in the data as early as 1987 to 1990, when angioplasty was almost never used to save the lives of heart attack patients. ''So this is not as simple as 'no doctor to do the procedure on weekends,' '' Dr. Hlatky said, adding that other factors might include staffing in coronary intensive care units.	1
The team did not even have to wait for Taubenberger to finish the whole sequence of the 1918 virus to begin testing its virulence. In 2001, Adolfo Garcia-Sastre and Christopher Basler, also at Mount Sinai, reconstructed the genes for just the two critical surface proteins and sent them on to Tumpey, at that time working at the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens, Ga. Taking advantage of influenza's innate ability to mix and match genes from two strains, he combined the two 1918 genes with others from an innocuous laboratory strain to make a complete set. Tumpey infected some lab mice, which are normally not affected much by human flus. Five days later, he came into the laboratory at around 11 at night for a quick check on their progress. All the mice were dead. In person, Tumpey is unnervingly imperturbable; ask him what it's like handling an infectious agent that killed perhaps 50 million people, and he stares back at you and gives a little shrug. But this first demonstration of the virus's power got to him.	0
''Now we have girls in the class, so I can't say it,'' he said, ''but I still tell them that nothing is worth losing the ability to have a family.'' Mr. Fusaro said he tried to keep his athletes working out at school, not at the local gyms. Meanwhile, Sachem's weight program, open even in the summer, is being used by more and more non-athletes and women. ''Back when I played there was very little weight training,'' he said. ''Now we have our ninth-graders lifting. You can't field a successful team today without a weight program.'' He said he has had no athletes taking steroids, but powders are a different story. ''The powders become a very sore subject, a taboo thing,'' he said. ''Coaches are not supposed to be getting involved. You know for a fact you got kids taking creatine, but they won't ask you about it, like they don't ask you about drinking.''	0
Dr. Salick began opening for-profit centers in 1986 in California, then expanded to Florida. He says that his niche is the 24-hour comprehensive service that patients can get in his centers, and that his deep knowledge of managed care, prevalent in California for a decade but still fairly new to this area, gives him an edge. He also provides the financing, badly needed by hospitals with dwindling resources, to get clinics off the ground. ''I have a highly credible reputation of running very cost effective facilities,'' Dr. Salick said in an interview. ''You have wonderful hospitals and wonderful doctors in New York, but there is a breakdown in the delivery system. You go to these places at nine at night and no one is there. Cancer is a disease that happens to go on 24 hours a day. All these other hospitals are doing is opening a center and sticking some doctors in there.''	0
The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine, an advocacy group that says it has more than 17,000 doctor members, wrote a response on its Web site: ''At no time has Congress evinced any intent to restrict ethical physicians from prescribing HGH to mature or elderly adults for medical reasons within their sound judgment.'' Amid the crossfire, most mainstream doctors advise caution. Dr. Takahashi wrote an article for the Mayo Clinic's Web site outlining the risks and approved uses of HGH, concluding that ''more study is needed.'' Conservative approaches to HGH therapy are being influenced by an evolution of thought on estrogen replacement therapy, Dr. Takahashi said. Once viewed as a remedy for postmenopausal changes, estrogen is now linked to increased cancer risk. ''We learned a lot from that experience,'' he said. ''It's possible that human growth hormone could allow people to be a little bit better for a little bit longer. The question is, at what price? I think it could be a pretty high price.''	0
The report is expected to be made public by the Pentagon on Wednesday, and it will doubtless lead to a new effort by veterans groups and some lawmakers to secure additional disability payments to veterans who have long complained of health problems they attribute to Agent Orange exposure. It will also fuel the longstanding scientific debate over whether Agent Orange is linked to a variety of other diseases, including cancer. The Air Force study found that there was ''no consistent evidence'' that the herbicide causes cancer, a finding backed by other studies. A copy of the executive summary of the report was made available to The New York Times by a government official who asked not to be identified. The executive summary does not provide the exact numbers of veterans in the study who were found to have diabetes, and it cautioned against trying to extrapolate the findings to all 3 million veterans of the Vietnam War. According to the American Diabetes Association, 15.7 million Americans, or about 6 percent of the population, have diabetes.	0
The study's findings have been released in two reports. The first came two years ago when the estrogen-plus-progestin part of the study was prematurely shut down because of data showing an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and breast cancer among women taking the hormone combination. Over the next 12 months, prescriptions that had once soared -- to 91 million in 2001 -- nose-dived. Sales of hormones overall fell 38 percent while sales of Prempro, the popular mix of estrogen and progestin that was the subject of the study, fell 74 percent, according to a study published this year in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Other research commissioned by drug companies showed that 18.5 million women used hormone therapy in 2002, but that had dropped to 7.6 million by January 2004. Leonard Wood, president of Multi-sponsor Surveys Inc. of Princeton, N.J., a private research firm, said that sales used to be equally divided between menopausal women and older women hoping for anti-aging benefits. ''What you're left with now is women experiencing significant problems with menopause,'' he said.	0
''The data showed that bleeding didn't work,'' Dr. Freedman said. But, he said, ''Dr. Louis rejected this as terrifying and absurd.'' So, he made a recommendation: bleed earlier and bleed harder. THE NATION	1
Many of Sloan-Kettering's most prominent doctors will help oversee the development of the center, and patients whose cancers are diagnosed there may be referred to Sloan-Kettering for drug trials or other treatments, something that many Harlem patients can ill afford and know little about. The move may reflect Dr. Varmus's interest in applying more of the hospital's research toward clinical care for a broader swath of patients. Easy access to good care is crucial to early diagnoses of cancer, both doctors said. Late detection is the No. 1 reason that people die from treatable forms of cancer, and studies have shown that many forms of cancer are detected later in blacks than in whites. For instance, in a 20-year study of more than 700 women in Harlem that ended in 1986, only 30 percent had survived breast cancer five years after diagnosis, compared with national rates closer to 65 percent, Dr. Freeman said. Looked at another way, the study found that only 6 percent of the women had early-stage, or the most treatable, cancers. Since the center's inception, that rate has risen to 40 percent, Dr. Freeman said.	0
''Hey, this is a capitalist society,'' says Wayne W. Grody, a U.C.L.A. molecular geneticist who has been at the center of this debate for years. ''People like Slavin took advantage of that. You know, the way I see it is, If you think of doing that on the front end, more power to you.'' Question of Consent The difference between Ted Slavin and John Moore wasn't that Slavin owned his tissues and Moore didn't. (No court ruled that Slavin had the right to control his excised tissues; he just did it.) The difference was information. Someone told Slavin that his tissues were special and that scientists might want them. So he was able to control his tissues by establishing his terms before anything left his body. In other words, he was informed, and he gave consent. In the end, the question isn't whether people have the ability to control their tissues; it is how much science should be obligated (ethically and legally) to put them in the position to do so.	0
Set in Southern California at the Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, home to one of the nation's best neonatal units, Mr. Humes's narrative follows the infant patients, their families and a remarkable cadre of medical personnel. It is riveting story-telling. ''The most impressive, rewarding, distressing, chaotic, mesmerizing aspect of the N.I.C.U.,'' he writes, ''is that it never stops. There is never just one story unfolding, never just one life-and-death decision to make, never just one expression of joy or sorrow or bewilderment.'' Mr. Humes introduces his readers to the attending physician who works through the night and well into the morning, surrounded by mounds of patient files. A colleague says, ''Don't you hate all this routine work?'' The doctor shakes her head and replies: ''This isn't the routine. The babies are the routine. This is the interruption.'' There is the young mother slumped next to her daughter's incubator and singing softly. Then she whispers fiercely, ''We're going to do it, baby, I promise you that.''	0
''My oldest son won't let me see my grandchildren,'' said Sherry Steele, 57, a surgical assistant who started working at the clinic after her daughter had two abortions. The New York Times agreed to anonymity to encourage candor and to get a representative sample of women. (Those who volunteer their full names are by nature an unrepresentative minority.) On this August weekend, the women entering the Little Rock clinic resembled those who have abortions nationwide. They were mainly in their 20's, more likely to be poor and African-American than the area population. Most were already mothers, many single. They arrived as a result of failure of one sort or another: a poor sexual decision, a broken relationship, a birth control method that just did not work. More than half of all women who have abortions say they used a contraceptive method in the month they conceived, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.	0
If either of those proves to be the case, it could help explain the still unsolved death of Kathy T. Nguyen, the 61-year-old hospital worker from the Bronx who died of inhalation anthrax Oct. 31. No trace of anthrax has yet been found in her Bronx apartment, the local post offices or the Manhattan hospital where she worked, and investigators were initially reluctant to believe that she could have contracted inhalation anthrax from what they termed a cross-contaminated piece of mail. The spore of anthrax found on the Seymour letter -- a personal letter delivered in October -- is not enough to make anyone ill, said Dr. Joxel Garcia, the Connecticut public health commissioner. But its presence lends credence to the growing suspicion among state and federal officials that Mrs. Lundgren, because of her advanced age, could have been killed by a fraction of the 8,000 to 10,000 spores that epidemiologists say are necessary to infect the average person.	0
''Treatment of Alzheimer's disease patients with these drugs is not justified,'' Dr. Aisen said. Nor should anyone take anti-inflammatories in the hope of preventing Alzheimer's, he said, adding: ''People who are looking to reduce their risk of Alzheimer's disease should not take these drugs until the results of prevention trials are in and we can weigh the risks and against the benefits.'' He said it was possible, but not likely, that the drugs in the study might have shown a benefit if they had been given for a longer time. ''Because the results at one year were so clearly negative,'' Dr. Aisen said, ''I'm not planning to do a longer treatment trial.'' Rather, he is looking into other possible treatments, including B vitamins, which might lower levels of homocysteine, an amino acid thought to play a role in heart disease and Alzheimer's. Another promising possibility, Dr. Aisen said, is to identify drugs that would inhibit an enzyme, beta secretase, which appears to lead to the release of plaque-making proteins in the brain.	0
The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists has recommended that doctors widen the net by considering other factors, including body mass index; a more sensitive test of insulin resistance; age, exercise habits and ethnic background; and family history of Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Some experts believe doctors should also look carefully for high levels of C-reactive protein because of its role in inflammation. ''CRP is one important part of the metabolic syndrome and an important cause of the consequences of metabolic syndrome,'' Dr. Einhorn said. Dr. Steven Nissen, the lead author of one of two CRP studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine this year, agreed. ''The elevation of inflammation is likely a key reason why metabolic syndrome leads to accelerated coronary disease risk,'' he said. Some experts are also looking at another possible risk factor to add to the syndrome: fibrinogen, a protein that signals the body to form or break down blood clots.	0
One group having trouble winning access to treatment is the poor, among whom obesity is an especially acute concern. Doctors say that Medicaid programs in many states have been reluctant to pay for the procedures. At the University of California at Davis, for example, Medi-Cal patients face a 12-year wait for bariatric surgery, said Dr. Bruce M. Wolfe, a bariatric surgeon and professor of surgery. Medi-Cal reimburses Davis for the procedure at less than a third of the hospital's cost. ''Basically they're not getting access to the care,'' he said. ''They will suffer the consequences of untreated obesity.'' Most bariatric procedures produce weight loss by restricting the intake of food. Part of the stomach is partitioned off and the intestines are rerouted. Afterward, many patients lose their outsize appetites. ''Patients can eat smaller amounts and feel satisfied,'' said Dr. Alan C. Wittgrove, a San Diego surgeon who is president of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery. But there can also be unpleasant consequences: if they eat too much, patients may vomit.	0
Fox, which is not known for squeamishness -- the network has produced ''When Animals Attack'' and ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' -- declined, in large part because the project seemed ''loaded with ethical questions'' as an entertainment program, the executive said. Joe Earley, a Fox spokesman, said only, ''We were pitched the project, but we thought it was more appropriate for our news department and we referred it to them.'' Fox News declined to make an offer, the executive said. Dr. Guillen approached other news divisions and cable companies as well, including ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN and HBO, media executives said. An executive at one network said the offer, which would have given his network little editorial control and would have meant significant payments to Dr. Guillen, was ''not the way we do things.'' The executive said the proposed exclusive documentary about the process of creating the first human clone was offered for a price in the ''low six figures.''	0
Drug companies have rushed to invest in the new research; today nearly every major company is competing to develop antiobesity drugs. And researchers who had embarked on their work out of scientific curiosity are starting to hope they might strike it rich with a magic pill that will melt away pounds. Until research succeeds, though, many fat people are left with few options. ''It's a very difficult situation,'' said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, an obesity researcher at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. ''You have to be very careful about instituting treatment for something when you know from first principles that the treatment is not likely to be efficacious.'' ''On the other hand,'' Dr. Leibel added, ''the patients are so desperate.'' A Losing Battle Some weight loss programs promote special food combinations. Others advise calorie counting. But the bottom line is almost always the same: losing weight and keeping it off is a matter of diet, exercise and discipline.	1
Still, Dr. Pickhardt says, it is the best procedure. Sigmoidoscopy does not show the entire colon, and the fecal occult blood test has too many false positives and false negatives. Dr. Beck also believes that colonoscopy is best. ''You visualize the entire mucosa,'' he says. ''If we find something, we can treat it. The other tests don't completely examine the colon, they are not as accurate, and if we find something, you have to have a colonoscopy.'' That reasoning is persuasive, said Dr. Robert Smith, director of screening at the American Cancer Society. Still, ''we recommend and encourage options because the public does not have universal access to screening colonoscopy, and studies have shown that a significant proportion of the public prefers a different test.'' Dr. Pignone says that informed patients are divided on which test they prefer. ''People think they know what patients want,'' he said. ''If you don't ask them, you have no idea.''	1
But wait a minute. Don't those compelling five-year survival statistics of 80 percent vs. 15 percent prove that CT screening works? The short answer is no. You have to consider exactly how a five-year survival rate is figured. It is a fraction. Imagine 1,000 people diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago. If 150 are alive today, the five year survival is 150/1000, or 15 percent. Yet even if CT screening raised the five-year survival rate to 80 percent, it is entirely possible that no one gets an extra day of life. The best way to understand this paradox is to work through a thought experiment. First, consider a group of people with lung cancer who will all die at age 70. If they first receive the diagnosis when they are 67, their five-year survival rate would be zero percent. But if these same people had received their diagnoses earlier -- at, say, age 63 -- the five-year survival rate would be 100 percent. Yet death would still come at 70 for all of them. Earlier diagnosis always increases the five-year survival statistic, but it doesn't necessarily mean that death is postponed.	0
Dr. Wu and many of his colleagues have trouble sleeping at night. When he does sleep, he has nightmares that he is still in a pneumonia ward. On Wednesday night, for example, he dreamed that he had absent-mindedly entered a ward with only a single mask, and was inhaling a potentially lethal concentration of viral particles. ''I'd be bound to be infected in that case,'' he said. ''I woke up immediately because it was so scary.'' Such is the terror of the disease here, and so great are the risks from daily trips into the pneumonia wards, that Dr. Wu does not tell casual acquaintances about what he does, lest they shun him. He has not even told his parents or his wife's parents. ''They would have gone crazy with this outbreak,'' he said. Although he agreed to an interview, Dr. Wu refused to go to a restaurant or any other public place in case he had any of the virus on him and might infect others. Instead, he insisted on the doctor's lounge of his hospital, Prince of Wales, explaining that the room, just off the deserted hospital lobby, had a separate air-conditioning system from the rest of the hospital.	0
In the wake of that announcement, the medical community reached a consensus that estrogen and progestin supplements should not be prescribed for more than a few years. The new findings help to fill out the factors in deciding to use hormone therapy even in the short term. They are also consistent with the results of another large study, reported in 1998, which found an increased risk of heart attack soon after the start of hormone therapy. One possible explanation is that hormone therapy appears to have an immediate effect on blood clotting, Dr. Manson said. ''If a woman has a narrowed blood vessel, the sudden increase in clotting can lead to a heart attack very rapidly,'' she said. Dr. Manson noted that women who take hormones to treat the hot flashes and night sweats that sometimes accompany menopause tend to be in their early 50's, so that their risk of heart attack is, on average, less than one half of one percent. Even if doubled, that risk remains less than one percent.	0
Lillie Shockney  Breast cancer survivor, registered nurse, Johns Hopkins Breast Center, Baltimore I'm a huge fan of mammography. My cancer was found accidentally on a mammogram. It was 10 years ago. I was 38, and I had a baseline mammogram. I had found a lump on my right breast, which ended up being a cyst. But they found an invasive tumor in my left breast. It was just four millimeters, very tiny, and would only have been found on a mammogram. If I had waited until I was 40 to have my baseline, I probably would not be talking with you right now. I had no family history, no known risk factors, like smoking or early menstruation or having a first child after age 30. Seventy percent of women with breast cancer have no known risk factors. Mammography is still at this moment in time our best weapon for early detection. I cannot imagine a woman not pursuing it.	0
The growing use of the costly defibrillators is drawing particular attention. Until recently, such units were typically implanted by highly trained heart device specialists. But since last year, when the government agreed to pay for tens of thousands more patients annually to get such devices, many new practitioners like those in Rock Hill have entered the field. One result is that patients do not realize that the training and experience of doctors can vary widely. ''A patient does not know whether they are a doctor's third implant or their 300th,'' said Dr. Charles E. Swerdlow, a heart device expert in Los Angeles who advocates rigorous training standards. To meet patient demand, the Heart Rhythm Society, a professional group that represents experts like Dr. Swerdlow, adopted so-called fast-track training guidelines two years ago for doctors who had not implanted defibrillators before. But those guidelines, of which the daylong written test is one part, are voluntary. No one knows what percentage of physicians who have recently begun to put in defibrillators are following the guidelines.	0
Some experts are deeply concerned. With marketing promotions that can shade the truth, referring doctors and patients can find it hard to distinguish between centers with good reputations, like RMA, and ones that promise much more than they can deliver. And some clinics that offer inducements like money-back guarantees may end up doing risky procedures hoping to improve the odds of pregnancy. For example, critics say, they may implant too many embryos -- the number that qualifies as too many depends on the woman's age and other factors. That raises the chances of pregnancy but also increases the odds the woman will end up with three or more fetuses, a hazard to mother and babies. ''You have desperate patients,'' said Dr. Barry Behr, who directs Stanford's in vitro fertilization laboratory and four others. ''And the potential is there to exploit vulnerable people.'' At the very least, said Dr. Alan Garber, an internist at Stanford, patients may want to know that the doctor who referred them to a fertility expert was accepting gifts and expensive dinners.	1
Some maple trees might leave southern New England, which would be a noticeable loss in foliage season. ''There will be changes that offend people,'' Dr. Mendelsohn said. ''But it appears that they will be more gentle than we thought. Scientists had feared that we'd go from some intact forests to moonscapes, but that's not likely to happen. We'll go from one type of ecosystem to another, which for most people will not be that dramatic.'' For Northerners, the savings in heating bills will offset the higher air-conditioning bills in the summer, Dr. Mendelsohn said, but Southerners will see their energy costs increase. Southern coastal dwellers will be more affected by the sea-level rise because there's more low-lying land in the South. Northern skiers will have their own problems. ''SKIING in New York State will undoubtedly be worse,'' Dr. Mendelsohn said. ''But in fact, most outdoor recreation happens in the summer, so there would be a large increase in outdoor recreation from global warming. More people would be hiking and playing golf all fall, as they did this year.''	0
In the nebulous language of eulogy, Ellen Roche, a bright, healthy, 24-year-old volunteer in an asthma study at Johns Hopkins University, died for the sake of science. In clinical terms, Ms. Roche died because a chemical she inhaled in the study led to the progressive failure of her lungs and kidneys. But in the plain speech that has been missing from official reports on the disastrous experiment, medical experts say Ms. Roche's death on June 2 was almost certainly caused by the failure of scientists and administrators charged with her well-being to recognize that the experiment was unsafe. Still, while they agree that clues about the risky nature of the experiment are clear in retrospect, scientists and other experts around the country remain divided about whether the evidence was obvious enough at the time to assign culpability to one researcher, to Hopkins, or to the overall system for assessing research involving humans in the United States.	0
''Compared to aspirin, statins are about tenfold safer for serious adverse events,'' Dr. Fonarow said. Half of those who start taking statins stop within a year. And most who say they are simply going to lose weight, exercise regularly and change their diets backslide. ''Patients don't like to think of themselves as having a condition that requires that they watch what they eat and perhaps take medicine for the rest of their lives,'' said Dr. David Waters, a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. ''You could blame it on the patients,'' Dr. Waters said. ''You could blame it on the doctors. You could also blame it on the health care system. Health care plans don't really care if you get your cholesterol tested and treated. It's a combination of factors.''	1
She is also awaiting a membership card from the H.M.O. that will administer her benefits. She does not realize that such cards take months to arrive. By the time she pieces this puzzle together, months later, she figures it is too late to have Medicaid pay her hospital bill. In fact, it might not be, but she does not try. She is eager to start treating her tumor, but before she can, she realizes that she is pregnant. She could hardly be more stunned -- she has been told that her untreated tumor makes her infertile -- and she blames her lack of insurance. If she had health care, she reasons, the tumor would be under control, she would have known that pregnancy was possible, and she would have used birth control. ''This just seems like something in a movie or something, like I'm watching it but it couldn't really be happening to me,'' she says.	0
This eventually led to the current class, or serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, the Prozac-like compounds that so many people take today. Q. As a witness-participant to one revolution, how did you react when the human genome was mapped? A. I felt this is the great story of my time. The world of medicine and health will change because of it. Instead of diagnosing people after they have begun to experience illness, we will, at some point in the future, be able to predict who is likely to be vulnerable to a problem. For a physician to be able to stop something from going wrong is much better than trying to fix something once it has gone wrong. Many of the most frequently occurring diseases such as Alzheimer's and depression have genetic aspects. By pursuing genomic clues, we will be able to figure out interactions and maybe delay the onsets of these conditions.	0
This is something that Terrence Tumpey, among others, insists that we cannot afford. Earlier this month, the H5N1 virus recorded an extraordinary rash of cases, including four fatalities in Turkey, the first outside East Asia. All the victims appear to have caught the virus from eating or handling infected poultry. But most flu researchers worry that as the virus's range increases, so does the likelihood that somewhere, sometime, some random set of mutations will send it over the edge into transmissibility, unleashing a pandemic. Everyone agrees that at some point, another pandemic will come -- if not from this strain, then from some other one perhaps not even yet under surveillance. The best hope of containing its impact is to understand how it works. What are its mechanisms of infection and replication? How does it foil the host's immune response and jump from a conquered host to a fresh one?	0
On Wednesday afternoon, he stopped by the Indian Health Center in San Jose. As patients and employees took turns poking at the screen, an occasional ''What is it?'' or ''Oops!'' seemed to foretell what ballot workers might expect on Election Day. Mr. Morillo said that reactions to the touch screens have generally been mixed, and that Santa Clara County -- like every California county where similar electronic voting is in place -- would offer a paper ballot alternative for those who, for whatever reason, are not comfortable with the machines. ''The thing about the touch screen,'' he said, ''is that you either love it or hate it.''	0
All of this matters to the young woman -- a lot. In the examining room, she twice asks the nurse-practitioner what ''it'' looks like at this point. ''When does it start looking like a person?'' she asks. ''When can you see a face?'' She wants to know about brain waves (not yet measurable) and the presence or absence of a beating heart (it's there, in rudimentary form). She called for her appointment here the very morning she did her at-home pregnancy test. That this is a method designed solely for early pregnancy -- from the moment a woman knows she is pregnant to about nine weeks -- appeals to her almost as much, if not more than, the fact that it allows her to avoid a surgical abortion. Surgery scares her. ''Invasive'' is the word she uses, and she shudders when she says it. There will be no surgery for her -- unless this is one of those rare cases (about 2 percent, according to the latest clinical trials of mifepristone) when abortion by medication does not work and vacuum aspiration by machine, the most common method of abortion now, becomes necessary after all. And there will be no trek to a clinic, where anyone watching her enter and leave could make a reasonable surmise about her business there. No protesters to dodge, no one shouting ''baby killer.'' The office she is visiting today is tucked deep in a sprawling hospital complex in Rochester, where she lives. Hundreds of people come and go here all day for everything from vaccinations to gall-bladder operations to visits with hospitalized friends. And the doctor this young woman sees isn't even an OB-GYN. He's a pediatrician who developed an interest in medical abortion while treating pregnant teen-agers and who has lately been conducting research on mifepristone. How could even the most enterprising anti-abortion picketer figure out whom to buttonhole?	0
Dr. Yusuf was referring not just to device makers but also to interventional cardiologists, the specialists who do angioplasty and stenting. The technology was born 30 years ago when Dr. Andreas Gruentzig first used a catheter threaded into a coronary artery to inflate a tiny balloon inside a developing blockage. The arrival of a minimally invasive alternative to bypass surgery for restoring blood flow to ailing hearts led to a rush of investment in device companies. Small fortunes were made in the mid-1990s when stents were invented in response to angioplasty's biggest shortcoming -- the tendency of arteries to quickly reclose. Those fortunes became giant ones when drug-coated stents were introduced in the United States in 2003, sending the number of patients returning for repeat procedures below 10 percent. The Taxus stent from Boston Scientific, which arrived in 2004, achieved more sales in its first year than any health care product in history.	0
Maybe, the researchers thought, if they could immediately stop the virus with powerful drugs, the helper cells could survive and remain in the body, ready to direct an attack if the virus tried to re-emerge. And they might be there in sufficient numbers to hold the AIDS virus in check. That meant that the patients might be able to stop taking the drugs and let their immune systems control their infections. Dr. Walker and Dr. Rosenberg went to their hospital's ethics board and asked permission to do the experiment. ''This was a time when people said, 'Treat, treat, treat and never miss a dose,' '' Dr. Walker said. ''We said we want to stop therapy. They said, 'You're out of your mind.' '' It took a year to get approval. Now the study is well under way, with 40 patients in various stages of taking drugs or coming off them. So far, the results are preliminary but promising. ''We're extremely excited,'' Dr. Walker said.	1
''I think that they're being oversold,'' Mr. Kerner said. ''I especially think they're being oversold to young people.'' Both the media and analysts have overstated the size of the market for impotence drugs, said Matt Beebe, United States brand team leader for Cialis, the drug from Eli Lilly and the Icos Corporation that is the only impotence drug whose sales are increasing. The typical user of an impotence drug is a man in his early 60's who is married and wants to have sex a few times a month, as he has for years, Mr. Beebe said. ''They don't want to be turned into a 20-year-old again,'' Mr. Beebe said. ''They just want to be a man and not have to worry about sexual dysfunction.'' Viagra, the first impotence drug in pill form, generated enormous interest even before Pfizer began selling it in May 1998. Worldwide sales topped $1 billion in 1999, and some Wall Street analysts predicted that Viagra sales would reach several billion dollars annually. For example, in 1998 Morgan Stanley predicted sales would hit $2.6 billion in 2000, while Gruntal &amp; Company said they could reach $4.5 billion by 2004.	???
Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, said, ''I can confidently tell you that something will happen here.'' The federal officials and Dr. Lander acknowledged that finding money for the project would be difficult in a time of tight budgets. They said that new money would probably have to be appropriated by Congress and that the pharmaceutical industry might contribute because the information would be useful for drug development. The project, which might end up with a different name, would determine the sequence of the DNA in at least 12,500 tumor samples, 250 samples from each of 50 major types of cancer. By comparing the order of the letters of the genetic code in the tumor samples with one another and with sequences in healthy tissue, it should be possible to pinpoint mutations responsible for cancer. But the proposition is extremely daunting. In general, each tumor cell holds a full panoply of human DNA, a string of three billion letters of the genetic code. So determining the full sequence of all the tumors would be the equivalent of 12,500 human genome projects. At a cost of many millions of dollars for one genome, the full project would be out of the question for now.	0
Death rates from heart disease in New York City and its suburbs are among the highest recorded in the country, and no one quite knows why. Heart disease is more common among poorer people. Yet Nassau County, one of the 15 highest-income counties in the country, suffers heart disease death at a rate 20 percent above the norm, a review of death certificate records by The New York Times shows. Some New Jersey counties have similar rates. All the city boroughs except Manhattan have rates as high as rural counties in the South and Appalachia. The pattern has raised questions about whether people in the New York area live with an excess of heart disease risks -- stress, bad diets, too little exercise. But it has also prompted speculation that doctors in the area may lump deaths with more subtle causes into the heart disease category, making that toll look worse than it actually is.	0
This would seem to be a bind, because the benefits of family planning are profound: couples can organize their lives, financially and otherwise, when they are able to choose when to have children and how many to have. And, around the world, countries in which abortion is legal and contraception is widely available tend to rank among the lowest in rate of abortion, while those that outlaw abortion -- notably in Central and South America and Africa -- have rates that are among the highest. According to Stanley K. Henshaw of the Guttmacher Institute, recent drops in abortion rates in Eastern Europe are due to improved access to contraceptives. The U.S. falls somewhere in the middle in rate of abortion: at 21 per 1,000 women of reproductive age, it is roughly on par with Nigeria (25), much better than Peru (56) but far worse than the Netherlands (9). The Netherlands, where the teen pregnancy rate also ranks among the lowest in the world, has long been of interest to sex educators in the U.S. for the frankness of its approach. The national sex education course, called Long Live Love, begins at age 13. One of its hallmarks has been dubbed ''Double Dutch'' -- encouraging the use of both condoms and birth control pills. ''It's proven successful,'' says Margo Mulder of STI AIDS Netherlands, the Dutch health education center. ''It shows that when you discuss contraception and protection with students, they actually are careful. And I know that some people in the U.S. say that when you promote contraception, you're also promoting sex, but we've found that when you educate people, they don't have sex earlier. They think about it. So you're not promoting sex, you're helping them to be rational about doing it.''	0
I was not myself. It was a good month or two before I got myself out of the house. I told the doctors about the depression, and they said it was a normal thing and I'd get over it. I did, but it was still very emotional when it happened. I was so tired and teary. At that time, I had all of my family with  me -- my sisters, my brother, my mother and my husband, of course. That did help quite a bit because they came to my house. They talked to me on the telephone. They tried to get my spirits up, but who likes to be cut up? It got to the point that I really started to worry because it wasn't my nature to be this way. I never suffered from depression. This time around, I had my surgery on my 77th birthday. I'm sure my husband was worried about the depression. I was not nervous about being depressed, but about being in the operating room. I wouldn't say I was depressed this time around, but I was scared.	0
He ''isn't what most people would have expected from a Republican administration,'' said Dr. Annette Dickinson, president of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group for the dietary supplement industry. But, she said, ''he's been a breath of fresh air.'' She said her group wanted the agency to stop supplement makers from making false health claims or flouting good manufacturing practices, and supported the ephedra ban. Others regulated by the F.D.A. like the attention they are getting. Dr. Rhona Applebaum, the executive vice president and chief scientific officer of the National Food Processors Association, said that in her 20 years in the industry, she had never seen an F.D.A. commissioner pay so much heed to food. ''So yeah, we're pretty excited,'' she said. Part of Dr. McClellan's success, said Dr. Alan M. Garber, an internist and economist at Stanford, is that he is a pragmatist, not an ideologue. He also has a style that can be immensely appealing.	1
The researchers found that a woman's risk of a heart attack rises by 81 percent in the first year of hormone therapy. It levels off, so that after 5.6 years -- the length of the study -- the increased risk is 24 percent. Still, Dr. Manson and other physicians not connected to the study noted that the increase in risk may be worth taking for many women whose baseline risk of heart disease is low and who suffer severe hot flashes or night sweats during menopause. The Women's Health Initiative, a study of more than 16,000 women, was halted last July, three years early, after researchers found that subjects who took Prempro, a combination of estrogen and progestin, faced an unacceptably high risk of breast cancer by the fifth year of use. The researchers also found that the therapy increased a woman's risk of heart attack, stroke and blood clots.	0
But when Ms. Buchanan received a diagnosis of breast cancer a few years ago, she stayed with the local doctor who found her tumor, Dr. Rachel P. Dultz, at University Medical Center, a community hospital in Princeton, N.J. She just had a good, warm feeling about Dr. Dultz, she said, and could not imagine that she would receive better care from anyone else. ''If I went to a Sloan-Kettering, I'm sure there are fabulous people there, but you've got to have total confidence in the person who's going to be taking care of you,'' Ms. Buchanan said. Patsy Brandt of Cherry Hill, N.J., came to the opposite conclusion. She went to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, and never investigated any other options for her breast cancer treatment. ''It's sort of a no-brainer when one lives in a doable radius of a major teaching and research hospital,'' Mrs. Brandt said.	1
Some studies have suggested that increasing the dosage of cholesterol-lowering drugs provides added benefits, but the researchers in this study found no relationship. Similarly, this study, which involved people using six kinds of statins and three nonstatins, found no evidence that any one drug was more effective than another against dementia. The scientists note that their study's participants had an average age of 75 and that their statin use was assessed for a median of five years. It may be that statin use has to begin earlier in life or go on much longer to show an effect in preventing dementia. Yet when the scientists analyzed their data to consider the varying lengths of time their subjects had taken the drugs, they could still detect no preventive effect. The authors acknowledge that their work has certain limitations. The main reason people in this study were prescribed statins was their risk for heart disease, and some studies have suggested that heart disease itself is a risk for dementia. Yet even when only patients without heart disease were considered, the scientists still could find no significant reduction in risk.	0
Dr. Feldman added that radical prostatectomy, the principal treatment for prostate cancer, causes 50 percent to 70 percent of all patients to become impotent for at least some period of time. Radiation, the other form of aggressive treatment, can cause similar side effects as well as other complications, he added. There is also some risk: approximately 1 percent of patients who undergo a radical prostatectomy die from it. The P.S.A. detects prostate cancers 10 to 15 years earlier than was possible with the digital rectal exam. But because of the nature of prostate cancer -- it is overwhelmingly a disease that afflicts elderly men and is usually very slow-growing -- the early warning is often meaningless. The prostate gland, the size of a walnut, is located in front of the rectum and beneath the bladder. The gland produces the fluid portion of semen and secretes prostate specific antigen, a protein that is pumped into the bloodstream in higher-than-normal amounts by cancerous cells.	0
By the turn of the century, another diet was all the rage. It was the work of Horace Fletcher, who was inspired by the deplored American habit of devouring food, barely taking time to chew it. Eat only when you are hungry, he said, eat only those foods you crave, and chew every morsel of food until no more taste can be extracted from it. As proof, Fletcher gleefully told how his weight had plummeted. In June 1898, he weighed 205 pounds. Four months later he weighed 163, losing seven inches from his waist. He gained celebrity endorsements. Upton Sinclair chanced upon a magazine article about Fletcher. It was ''one of the great discoveries of my life,'' he wrote. John D. Rockefeller Sr. was Fletcherizing. ''Don't gobble your food,'' he wrote. ''Fletcherize or chew very slowly when you eat.'' But some became disillusioned. Henry James began with great enthusiasm, giving Fletcher's book ''The New Glutton'' to his neighbors and claiming it changed his life. He wrote to Edith Wharton about ''the divine Fletcher'' and to his friend Mrs. Humphrey Ward: ''Am I a convert, you ask? A fanatic.'' But after five years, he was having stomach troubles his doctor attributed to Fletcherism. James found himself ''more and more sickishly loathing food.''	1
''We do not believe sales will rise as a result of the new dosing regimen,'' Eric Ende, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, wrote in a report last week. The market for impotence drugs has stagnated since last summer, when reports linked the medicines to a rare form of blindness. Eight years after Pfizer, the world's largest drug market, introduced Viagra, the most popular impotence medicine, to enormous publicity, the market for the drugs appears to be saturated. Even with a major new ad campaign for Viagra this year, United States prescriptions for drugs for erectile dysfunction have been flat, compared with a 5 percent rise in prescriptions over all. The $2.5 billion or so of the drugs sold worldwide annually represent only 0.5 percent of the global prescription drug market. But Cialis continues to gain market share, mainly at the expense of Viagra. Lacy Fitzpatrick, a spokeswoman for Icos, said the company expected the market for impotence drugs to grow at about the same rate as the population of men over 40. Levitra, the third impotence drug, marketed by Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline, is a distant third worldwide.	0
Mr. Hutt thinks a number of prescription drugs, including statins to lower cholesterol and drugs to lower blood pressure, should be available over the counter. But neither he nor others expect major changes in how drugs are classified anytime soon. One reason is many doctors are concerned that patients will use medicines improperly, unless their doctors monitor them. During his time at the F.D.A., Mr. Vodra recalls, ''Every time someone said, 'We're going to make this drug available and we don't have to make doctors gatekeepers,' doctors came in and said, 'This is a horrible thing to do. A lot of people don't understand their bodies, their health and when and how to use drugs properly.''' On one hand, this view includes much truth, he said, but on the other it sometimes prevents people from having easier access to medicines they need.	1
Human embryonic stem cells may not be the only source of tissue needed to repair damaged organs. Alternative approaches from the mundane to the exotic are being explored to avoid the ethical controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells. Those cells are obtained by destroying human embryos, which some people view as human life. Still, it may be hard for the alternative approaches to measure up to the potential of embryonic stem cells, which have two attributes that make them attractive for regenerative medicine. They are versatile, in that they can be turned into any other type of tissue or cell in the body, at least in theory. And they can be easily multiplied in culture, providing an ample supply of cells. What follows is an assessment of the other possibilities. ADULT STEM CELLS -- These are the most frequently mentioned alternative. Certain tissues, like the bone marrow and brain, harbor small reservoirs of stem cells that the body uses to replenish its tissues.	0
But Ms. Kayser, now 64, said: ''My incision did not heal for seven months. I could not exercise, and I stopped losing weight. The incision became infected, and I had to have surgery by a wound care specialist. In addition, after four months, I developed a hernia, a bulge in my tummy.'' Bariatric surgery often alleviates conditions that occur with obesity, like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. That was the case with Ms. Kayser, who said she no longer needed to take diabetes medications because her blood sugar levels were under control. Dr. Philip R. Schauer, president of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery, estimates that 175,000 to 200,000 weight-loss procedures will be performed this year, up from 47,000 in 2001. The number of people receiving the operation ''may be less than 1 percent of those who need it,'' said Dr. Schauer, director of bariatric surgery at the Cleveland Clinic.	0
After I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease two years ago, at the relatively young age of 52, I read everything I could about the condition's usual ''progression'' -- an odd word for degeneration. The worst-case prognosis is grim: a long slide into physical and mental incapacity. That is not going to happen to me, I said, as I began measuring my physical decline. I am young enough that I may be able to benefit from advances in medicine, especially in brain research. Maybe with new medications I would be able to put off taking L-dopa, the best drug for Parkinson's but one that loses its effectiveness over time. Surely better treatments will become available, I told myself. So why didn't I welcome the news that researchers in South Korea were able to clone a human embryo and extract viable stem cells from it? After all, one of the researchers said their goal was ''not to clone humans, but to understand the causes of diseases'' -- and one of the diseases named most often was Parkinson's. Scientists say they may one day find a way to develop stem cells into brain cells to replace the ones that are killed or disabled by Parkinson's.	0
In back-to-back papers in the nation's two most prestigious medical journals last summer, Dr. Woolhander and her co-authors spelled out their view of health care reform. Drs. Woolhandler, Himmelstein, Marcia Angell (the former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine and a senior lecturer at Harvard) and Quentin D. Young (national coordinator of the Physicians for a National Health Program) published a paper in The Journal of the American Medical Association in August calling for a single-payer system. It was endorsed by 8,000 other doctors. A week later, Dr. Woolhandler and Dr. Himmelstein wrote an article in The New England Journal of Medicine arguing that administrative costs were breaking the back of the American health care system. Q.  How does the United States compare to other industrialized countries in health care expenditures? A.  We spend about twice as much on health care -- $5,600 per person in 2003 -- as the average in other developed nations, yet we still have more than 41 million uninsured.	0
''It's a prime opportunity,'' said Dr. D'Onofrio, who recently gave a presentation on the issue to a conference of the American College of Emergency Physicians. ''Many of the people are young adults, and they don't use primary care, and they don't have insurance.'' Beyond that, emergency rooms have a way of attracting people with alcohol problems. Estimates vary, but by some counts perhaps a quarter of the people who end up in emergency rooms with some kind of trauma are intoxicated. Even for those who are sober, a disproportionate number are found on further evaluation to have drinking problems. ''I can make the case that a two-minute screen for alcohol-use disorder'' can help doctors discover other medical problems patients may be at risk for, said Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and a former emergency room doctor. ''Not to mention the risk of motor vehicle injuries, the risk of spousal abuse, for falls, for other types of injuries.''	0
It takes a trained doctor about four and a half minutes to ''fly'' up the colon and another four and a half to make a sweep back down, Professor Kaufman said. ''We even paint the surface walls we haven't seen on the way up,'' he added. ''Then when we fly back down we can focus on the areas that were not seen before.'' He said the view up the colon covered about 80 percent of the organ, and the view on the return trip added 15 percent more. ''The last 5 percent is deep cavities and sharp bends, and our system lets the physician step through these areas and examine each one until he's seen 100 percent of the entire colon,'' Professor Kaufman said. The technology is licensed to Viatronix Inc., a company that makes medical imaging products. Professor Kaufman said ''three or four Army hospitals are doing very extensive clinical studies comparing virtual colonoscopy to the conventional method.''	0
He said several other researchers had also found that the drugs seemed to have less effect on the heart than initially suspected. The American Home Products Corporation, the maker of fenfluramine, has offered to pay more than $4 billion to settle lawsuits filed by consumers, and Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, the maker of dexfenfluramine, has offered $70 million. Phentermine, the ''phen'' part of the drug regimen, has not been associated with health problems and remains on the market. A spokeswoman for American Home said the company had no comment on the Boston study.	1
''At my age, you adjust to things,'' he said. But in Princeton, Dr. Dultz's patient, Ms. Buchanan, is just as devoted to her and to the hospital there. Dr. Dultz said she encouraged her patients to seek second opinions, but only half do, and nearly all decide to stay at the Princeton hospital. As a result, Dr. Dultz said, she ends up operating on about 200 women a year, which puts her and the hospital into the high-volume category. Those who leave for major medical centers tell her they were persuaded by other family members, she added. A small hospital offers more than the mechanics of medicine, Dr. Dultz said. She tries to always be there for her patients, giving out her home phone number and her cellphone number, meeting patients in the emergency room, going into her office to see patients early in the morning or after her staff has left for the day.	1
After training at Mount Sinai Medical Center, he spent a year at the Veterans Administration Hospital in the Bronx while waiting to start a fellowship in cardiology. It was there, charged with making a clinic ''more patient-oriented,'' that he became absorbed by a vision of creating an institute dedicated to ''re-establishing compassion and humanism in medicine.'' I stopped him. ''Re-establishing? When was it there? When barbers were the surgeons?'' Dr. Neuwirth can be intense, but he is not without humor and a willingness to negotiate. The first commandment of medicine, ''Do no harm,'' was clearly a measure of humanity and compassion, he said.  Since then there have been stunning lapses. Blaming managed care is easy and wrong, since unmanaged care was hardly perfect. In his vision of ''collaborative medicine,'' the doctor gathers and disseminates information. I think that is an extension of the doctor's power: patients should be in charge of their healing, as consumers and experts in their own needs.	0
Humans share mostly the same genes. The same genes are found in other animals as well. Our genetic makeup represents the common heritage of all life on earth. You can't patent snow, eagles or gravity, and you shouldn't be able to patent genes, either. Yet by now one-fifth of the genes in your body are privately owned. The results have been disastrous. Ordinarily, we imagine patents promote innovation, but that's because most patents are granted for human inventions. Genes aren't human inventions, they are features of the natural world. As a result these patents can be used to block innovation, and hurt patient care. For example, Canavan disease is an inherited disorder that affects children starting at 3 months; they cannot crawl or walk, they suffer seizures and eventually become paralyzed and die by adolescence. Formerly there was no test to tell parents if they were at risk. Families enduring the heartbreak of caring for these children engaged a researcher to identify the gene and produce a test. Canavan families around the world donated tissue and money to help this cause.	0
At the other end is the maximum heart rate. It can be crudely estimated by subtracting your age from 220. Ideally, it should be determined through a lab test. But Allen Lim, a former United States national cycling team coach who is doing research on endurance training at the University of Colorado, suggests finding your own maximum rate by wearing a monitor and performing as hard as you can for one to five minutes. (Assuming, of course, that you have cleared the idea of an aerobic exercise program with your doctor first.) All of the monitors I tried have a transmitter belt with an elastic strap and a plastic strip containing two flexible electrodes, some microchips, a battery and a radio. Once moistened and fitted around the chest, the belt picks up the heart's electrical impulses. While the belts look more or less the same, I found considerable differences once I snapped them on. Polar's transmitter belts were the most comfortable, even after several hours of wearing. The Timex belt was the biggest and the least comfortable. (A spokesman for Timex said the company would introduce a smaller belt in late summer.)	0
Dr. Susan Sieber, the deputy director for communications for the National Cancer Institute, said that in the absence of a proven and direct relationship between breast cancer and the pollutants looked at in the Stellman study, ''we have to fall back on general health measures that we hope will provide a protective effect.'' She said these included prudent diet, exercise, no smoking, and drinking only in moderation. She said a leading theory among cancer researchers involved what she called the gene-environment interaction and how it may determine how environmental conditions increase cancer risks. The Long Island groups said they agreed with the general health measures but objected to any implication that breast cancer rates on Long Island were higher principally because too many women failed to follow such guidelines or had genetic makeups that made them susceptible to breast cancer. Dr. Stellman and the leaders of the breast cancer groups agreed that a geographic information system, which is being set up as part of the Long Island breast cancer project,  would be valuable. The system will seek links between breast cancer rates and current and past exposures to a variety of environmental conditions. These include contaminated drinking water, hazardous waste sites, electromagnetic fields, pesticides and toxic chemicals, and indoor and outdoor air pollution, including aircraft emissions.	0
''It's a horrendous experience, just an explosion of emotions at once,'' says Dr. Gerald L. Lourie, another team member. ''You know you are either going to be free as the judge says, 'Not guilty,' or you look and you know you just missed this one cold.'' What distinguishes the Denver team from most others is its systematic embrace of frequently occurring shame. The regimen begins with competency tests, in which the doctors run through a stack of mammograms. Many mammogram doctors never take even one such quiz. In Denver they do so at least three times a year. Not only do these tests allow the doctors to study their errors; they also build confidence for those who do well. Once a year, Dr. Adcock also sends out lists of actual cancers missed, known as false negatives, so the doctors can pull the files and commit their mistakes to memory. ''That's your boss telling you, 'These are the ones that weren't so hot,' '' says one of the doctors, Richard A. Propper.	0
Alpha interferon, a drug used to treat hepatitis C, will be a ''prime candidate'' for clinical trials for a SARS treatment, Dr. Fauci said. In the mid-1980's, Dr. Ronald Turner, then of the University of Utah and now at the University of Virginia, found that alpha interferon, sprayed into the noses of volunteers, reduced symptoms when the volunteers were then exposed to a coronavirus that causes the common cold. The interferon caused nasal irritation severe enough to make it unacceptable as a treatment for colds. But the side effects might be acceptable for a more serious disease like SARS, Dr. Turner said. However, it is ''pretty iffy'' that the approach would work against SARS, he said. The government is also looking at other immune therapies, like extracting antibodies to the SARS virus from the blood of people who have recovered from the disease. Scientists will also look for drugs that block crucial enzymes the virus uses for replication, like proteases. This approach has been successful in treating diseases like AIDS. The drugs used to treat those diseases are not expected to work on SARS because the enzymes are different, but the approach might be used.	0
Dr. Lobo said he had been moving toward lower doses of estrogen over the last several years. It is logical to assume that lower doses will pose less risk to breast and heart health, he said, though no studies have proved that. Dr. Lobo also sometimes prescribes lower doses of progestin. Some women, he has found in his own practice, can take it for just 10 to 12 days every two or three months. Estrogen can be given in the form of patches, too, which are typically placed on the abdomen. The patches deliver a steady stream of estrogen or estrogen plus progestin directly to the bloodstream for a few days or a week at a time. Some believe that patches may be safer because the estrogen does not go directly through the liver. ''This is also effective for menopause symptoms,'' said Dr. Deborah Grady, director of the Mount Zion Women's Health Clinical Research Center at the University of California in San Francisco. ''But has anyone ever tested transdermal estrogen to see if it's more safe? Well, no.''	0
Useful Resources Established in 1991, the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, 10400 Eaton Place, Suite 107, Fairfax, Va. 22030, (800) 929-4040, fax (703) 691-2713, offers a wealth of information, including a bulletin at www.foodallergy.org outlining food and allergy policies at various airlines. An associated group, the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Alliance, www.foodallergyalliance.org, links allergists in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Britain and the United States.

Everyone who has even thought about exercising has heard the warnings about lactic acid. It builds up in your muscles. It is what makes your muscles burn. Its buildup is what makes your muscles tire and give out. Coaches and personal trainers tell athletes and exercisers that they have to learn to work out at just below their ''lactic threshold,'' that point of diminishing returns when lactic acid starts to accumulate. Some athletes even have blood tests to find their personal lactic thresholds. But that, it turns out, is all wrong. Lactic acid is actually a fuel, not a caustic waste product. Muscles make it deliberately, producing it from glucose, and they burn it to obtain energy. The reason trained athletes can perform so hard and so long is because their intense training causes their muscles to adapt so they more readily and efficiently absorb lactic acid. The notion that lactic acid was bad took hold more than a century ago, said George A. Brooks, a professor in the department of integrative biology at the University of California, Berkeley. It stuck because it seemed to make so much sense.	1
Even the motivation argument is debated. One study found that patients who saw an artery scan showing that they had atherosclerosis were more inclined to change their ways. Another found that patients who saw scans of their hearts indicating atherosclerosis did not change their habits in the end, said Dr. Sidney Smith, a heart researcher at the University of North Carolina. ''It remains an untested question how patients might be motivated when they see their CRP,'' he said. Dr. Smith has participated in research that was sponsored by companies making heart drugs and has spoken at company-sponsored symposiums at medical meetings. Some researchers, like Dr. Scott Grundy of the University of Texas Southwestern, do not measure CRP in most patients. People who are diabetic or obese, who smoke or who have high levels of cholesterol or high blood pressure should be doing something to address those risk factors anyway, said Dr. Grundy, who has conducted research that was supported by companies making drugs for heart disease and has received honorariums from drug companies.	1
Many young doctors dream of having an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Hacib Aoun achieved this, but not in the manner he expected. Dr. Aoun's piece, ''When a House Officer Gets AIDS,'' appeared in the Sept. 7, 1989, edition of the journal. It told the story of how, in 1983, as a 27-year-old medical resident, he contracted the disease from a workplace accident. Dr. Aoun's candor, and the journal's willingness to publish his first-person account of his illness, helped capture the terror, and the arbitrariness, of the early years of the AIDS epidemic. Fifteen years later, in an era of triple-drug therapy for H.I.V. infection, Dr. Aoun's piece reads like ancient history, but it also remains surprisingly relevant. I vividly recall seeing the article for the first time. I had just completed medical school and residency in New York. Like other doctors in training then, I had been caught unaware by the gravity of AIDS. And I had had my share of possible exposures to H.I.V., the virus that causes it.	0
Christina Pearson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Leavitt, refused to say whether Bush administration officials had asked for the resignation. ''I can't comment,'' Ms. Pearson said. ''This is a personnel issue.'' In recent weeks, consumer advocates and scientists inside and outside the agency had said scientific decisions were being warped by politics. On Thursday, a commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine titled ''A Sad Day for Science at the F.D.A.'' said that ''recent actions of the F.D.A. leadership have made a mockery of the process of evaluating scientific evidence,'' disillusioned many scientists, ''squandered the public trust and tarnished the agency's image.'' Mr. Bush said he intended to name Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, director of the National Cancer Institute, to be acting commissioner of food and drugs. Dr. Crawford, a veterinarian and expert on food safety, was named deputy commissioner of the agency in early 2002 before his tenure as acting commissioner. In that time the agency has been rocked by disputes over many issues, including the safety of painkillers like Vioxx, the regulation of heart defibrillators and other devices, and delays in deciding whether to allow over-the-counter sales of an emergency contraceptive.	0
In a development that illustrates the vicissitudes of drug development, the Wyeth-Elan partnership suffered a major setback in 2002, when the first human trial of an Alzheimer's vaccine, called AN-1792, had to be halted. About 18 patients, or 6 percent of those enrolled, suffered inflammation in their brains. It was an apparent reaction to the vaccine, which used a strand of human protein to prompt an immune response. Despite the severe reactions of some patients, others in the interrupted trial may have responded positively to the vaccine, according to Wyeth's follow-up examinations. The symptoms of some patients who fared well in the trial appeared to have stabilized, a contrast to the inexorable decline usually experienced in Alzheimer's. Autopsies of five trial participants who later died of natural causes revealed evidence of plaque-clearing in their brains. The results supported the idea that Alzheimer's plaque can be attacked with immunotherapy. ''It looked like the vaccine was doing the same thing we've seen in the animals,'' Dr. Pangalos says.	0
But Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, chief of the molecular pathology department at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, had an idea for finding that ancient virus. He recalled that his institute had a warehouse of autopsy tissue, established by President Lincoln. Dr. Taubenberger investigated and found tissue from two soldiers who died of the 1918 flu, one in Massachusetts, one on Long Island. The tissue was snips of lung soaked in formalin and encased in little blocks of wax. In that tissue was the virus, broken and degraded, but there, untouched for nearly 80 years. Then Dr. Taubenberger received a third sample, from a woman who had died in Brevig, Alaska, when the flu swept through her village, killing 72 adults and leaving just five. The dead were buried in a mass grave in the permafrost. A retired pathologist, Johan Hultin, hearing of Dr. Taubenberger's quest, had traveled from his home in San Francisco at his own expense. He dug up the grave with the villagers' permission, extracted the woman's still frozen lung tissue and sent it to Dr. Taubenberger.	1
''There's a network of people, and lot of information is on the Internet now,'' said Shannon Abbey of Woodbine, Ga., a 35-year-old Navy wife who had her son Noah Michael Chase last June, after two in vitro cycles at a clinic in Naples. ''People are more willing to tell you where they went, how they got there, the name, the address.'' Ms. Abbey, for instance, learned that several Navy wives on her husband Kevin's ship, the La Salle, had gone to Italy for help conceiving. She moved there while her husband was mostly deployed at sea, in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere. The prices in Italy ranged from $2,500 to $4,000 for treatments, and a few hundred dollars for medications that cost thousands in the United States. Now, she is in touch with Navy wives and other couples who are flocking everywhere for in vitro fertilization: Colombia, France, Belgium, South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore.	0
''There were people dabbling in the disease, but their major frustration was that they had just four or five families,'' Ms. Terry said. She saw an opportunity. Establishing a foundation, PX International, Ms. Terry and her husband found 2,000 people with the disease, set up a repository to store tissue samples, and began raising money for research. It took them just four years. ''We said, 'We can get you as many sibling pairs and as many patients as you want,' '' Ms. Terry said she told researchers. The group had no trouble finding scientists who were eager to work with them. ''They are so delighted that we will do all the grunt work,'' she said. The researchers happily signed her group's agreement, Ms. Terry said. They readily agreed to its clause saying that the foundation had to be named in any patent applications arising from the work, that any profits or revenue from the discoveries had to be shared with the foundation and that any genetic test must be made readily available to the foundation, she said.	1
Fundamental questions remain unanswered, but the general direction is clear, the scientists said. For now, what they have is a proof of principle and a staggering vision of the future. ''It is going to be very hard for us to deal with,'' said Dr. Stock, who is director of the program on medicine, technology and science at the U.C.L.A. medical school. The idea of expanding the human life span to 150, 200 or more years, ''puts a distance between ourselves and all of our history,'' he said. And it puts humans in uncharted waters. ''All of human wisdom on how to live a life,'' no longer would apply, Dr. Stock said. Dr. Jan Vijig, the director of basic research and a professor of physiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, added: ''We have a few small starting points now. We have never been in a position like this before.''	1
''You would hope that if a case was brought it would be laughed out of court,'' Mr. Bernstein, the law professor, said. Lawyers who have represented Bendectin plaintiffs agree that it may be hard to bring new lawsuits. ''Unless there is new evidence supporting the causal relationship between Bendectin and birth defects, lawyers are going to be reluctant to bring cases because they will fear that judges won't allow their experts on the stand,'' said Michael Gottesman, a Georgetown law professor who argued for the Bendectin plaintiffs before the Supreme Court. Barry Nace, a Washington lawyer  who has represented close to 200 Bendectin families, said the lawsuits were generally hopeless. ''You might say that this is the safest drug in terms of litigation,'' Mr. Nace said. ''It's judicial door-slamming -- they make it so hard for plaintiffs to win these cases that it almost doesn't matter what you say.'' As for the drug's safety, Mr. Nace said, ''In my mind, there is no question that Bendectin causes birth defects.'' He added that every time he saw a young person with missing fingers or a shortened arm or club feet, he thought of the drug. ''I want to walk up to them and say, 'Did your mother take Bendectin?' '' he said.	1
Such disputes between commercial interests and researchers have become more common as drug companies increasingly use independent scientists to test new drugs. Immune Response hopes to get F.D.A. approval for the vaccine within two years. David Korn, senior vice president of the Association of American Medical Colleges and an expert on financial conflicts between researchers and industry, said such disputes were rarely made public and rarely involved so much money. He would  not speculate on the outcome. ''We are now getting into an era when the commercial entanglements for science are getting so common and complicated that I think it's time for the scientific community to have guidelines and to define the limits beyond which behavior is not tolerated,'' Dr. Korn said. Under the contract between the researchers and the company, either party could demand arbitration of  unresolved disputes. Immune Response demanded that the authors not publish their paper,  sought arbitration and asked for $7 million to $10 million if the investigators published the article as they had written it. The company also withheld some of the data, so the researchers had perhaps only 90 percent of the amount collected, usually not enough to publish a paper.	0
Rudolph Silas, the lawyer for the Rogerses, said his clients also were struggling to live normal lives. Mr. Silas said both couples were angry with Dr. Nash but not with one another. ''The Fasanos are a little saddened that they are parting with a child, and the Rogerses are delighted that they are receiving a child,'' he said. Unlike Mrs. Fasano, Mrs. Rogers did not become pregnant after the in vitro procedures. Both women have tried for years to conceive. A study conducted by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine found that in 1996, 64,000 attempts at assisted reproduction were made nationally, mostly through in vitro fertilization, resulting in 20,659 births. A study by the State Health Department documented that 5,741 attempts at in vitro fertilization had been made in New York State in 1995, though the success rate could not be determined. The figures do not include cases of artificial insemination.	0
For the time being, Boisselier told me, the couple wanted to remain anonymous: ''Even their neighbors, friends and family don't know they're doing this.'' The family trusted her to represent their story -- all the details about them here were provided by her -- without revealing their identity. The couple weren't Ralians themselves, she said; far from it. They ''went to church every Sunday'' and were well known in their community. ''You have to understand, they are still grieving. It's hard for them to talk about the baby.'' But what, or who, I wondered, did they think they would be getting, if by chance the Ralians succeeded in growing another embryo from one of the dead boy's cells? ''Well, you see, if they just have another child, it will be a different one,'' Boisselier said matter-of-factly. ''And they say this child was unique. He was taken from us because of some malpractice at the hospital. He should be around us laughing and so on. He deserves to live again. And through cloning, there is a way for this genetic code to express itself so he can laugh and play and become whoever he was meant to become.''	0
Last year, diabetes was the sixth-leading cause of death in New York City, although city health officials said that the number of people who die from diabetes is probably underestimated. ''We don't use the word epidemic lightly,'' said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the city's health commissioner. ''This data gives us a remarkable sense of the diversity and disparity between rich and poor in the city,'' he added. ''Of all diseases New Yorkers suffer, diabetes and H.I.V. have the greatest disparities of race and class.'' In the city, 12.2 percent of Hispanics have diabetes, as do 10.8 percent of non-Hispanic blacks. Whites who are not Hispanic have the lowest rate -- 5 percent -- and Asians are second to last, with 6.8 percent. The Bronx leads the city in diabetics, with 11.5 percent of residents having the illness, while 4.6 percent of Staten Island residents have it. Dr. Frieden said the city would undertake an aggressive effort against the increase in diabetes rates. He has made addressing chronic diseases a focus of his department since he was appointed last year.	0
The study's findings have been released in two reports. The first came two years ago when the estrogen-plus-progestin part of the study was prematurely shut down because of data showing an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and breast cancer among women taking the hormone combination. Over the next 12 months, prescriptions that had once soared -- to 91 million in 2001 -- nose-dived. Sales of hormones overall fell 38 percent while sales of Prempro, the popular mix of estrogen and progestin that was the subject of the study, fell 74 percent, according to a study published this year in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Other research commissioned by drug companies showed that 18.5 million women used hormone therapy in 2002, but that had dropped to 7.6 million by January 2004. Leonard Wood, president of Multi-sponsor Surveys Inc. of Princeton, N.J., a private research firm, said that sales used to be equally divided between menopausal women and older women hoping for anti-aging benefits. ''What you're left with now is women experiencing significant problems with menopause,'' he said.	0
''All commissioners learn that they can have too many initiatives,'' Dr. Peck said. ''You can dilute your effort.'' Mr. Vodra, the former F.D.A. counsel, noted that Mr. McClellan's plans could be thwarted by the issue of money. ''The real issue is the challenge that anybody in this administration faces in trying to make do with less and less money,'' he said. ''At some point, you can't do the job.'' Then again, maybe he will. ''He's got a good connection at the White House; he knows Bush personally,'' Mr. Vodra said. ''So he's got access. From that standpoint, the F.D.A. is probably better situated than other agencies.'' SCIENTIST AT WORK: MARK B. MCCLELLAN	1
Large universities have always paid lip service to the importance of undergraduate education, but when they make hiring and promotion decisions, ''publish or perish'' generally rules. Weak teachers who publish in top journals often win promotions and tenure; prize-winning teachers whose publications are not deemed first-rate are often refused tenure. In recent years, many universities have added freshmen seminars so that incoming students can study with full professors in small classes as well as in large lecture halls. Some universities have created research programs where undergraduates can work side by side with professors and graduate students. Other universities have added centers where professors can burnish their teaching skills. Still others are re-examining their undergraduate programs to see how they might be improved. At Yale, a committee appointed by its president, Richard C. Levin, to study undergraduate education recommended last spring that the college offer more small classes for freshmen and sophomores, make more use of the university's professional school faculty in undergraduate education and expand its faculty.	0
''As soon as you tell people to eat supplemental foods, people think there are free calories and there are not,'' said Frank Sacks, professor of cardiovascular disease prevention at the Harvard School of Public Health. This is a particularly American way of thinking about food, said Greg Critser, author of ''Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World.'' ''The Europeans don't have this mentality,'' Mr. Critser said. ''There's more a culture of the enjoyment of food, not just the amount of food. The problem is that behind whatever diet is in ascent in this country, the background noise is one and the same: a license to gluttony.'' According to a survey of 1,182 people conducted in December for LowCarbiz, a new publication tracking the boom, 8.3 percent of respondents said they were on a low-carb diet and 20 percent said they were not on a diet but had been cutting back on high-carbohydrate foods.	0
''Just because we can do something doesn't mean that we should or we must,'' Dr. Fritz said. But single women like Ms. Drake, who view egg freezing as a reproductive insurance policy, have no such qualms. ''I would like to have children someday,'' she said, ''and I like knowing that I have taken advantage of everything currently available in order to give myself that option.'' Correction:  September 28, 2004, Tuesday  An article in Science Times last Tuesday about the growing market for human egg freezing to extend the years of fertility misidentified the clinic credited with having produced the first baby from a frozen egg in the United States. It was Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta, not Georgia Reproductive Specialists.	0
He added, ''Weight loss is not for the fainthearted.'' Of course, some people do lose weight and keep it off, often succeeding after repeated attempts to diet, said Dr. Rena Wing, a professor of psychiatry at Brown and a co-founder of the National Weight Control Registry. To be part of the registry, people must lose 30 pounds or more, by any means, including surgery, and keep the weight off for at least a year. If they regain, they remain in the registry, Dr. Wing said. ''Once you're in, you're in,'' she said. In 10 years, the registry has enrolled 4,700 people. Most gained back some weight, but very few gained back all they lost, Dr. Wing said. But there also are those who say they have tried and tried to reduce, only to regain the weight they so painfully lost. For many, weight loss is never really out of their minds. Often, the fatter the person, the greater the concern.	1
The reason is largely financial: Cancer is big business. Experts believe that cancer will soon overtake cardiovascular disease as the No. 1 killer in America as the population ages and cardio-care becomes more advanced. Cancer offers other financial incentives beyond the sheer flow of cases: the disease is still fairly immune from managed-care penny pinching, while at the same time, treatment advances have helped to streamline care. And there is constant excitement in the field: there are more than 300 cancer drugs in the pipeline. Offering Convenience And New Technology Much of the activity involves the opening of outpatient clinics, which are starting to flourish across the country as new technologies and changing medical economics allow patients to have chemotherapy and radiation treatments without staying overnight in a hospital. Continuum Health Partners, which runs Beth Israel and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, has built the new outpatient center at Union Square, and beefed up its breast cancer program at St. Luke's. It has poached several doctors from other, far more prestigious cancer centers to run many of its programs, and has spent over $400,000 last year on cancer advertising campaigns.	0
The study involves 3,000 Long Island women, half of whom were diagnosed with breast cancer during the same one-year period. Some participants have permitted the collection of dust, water and soil from their homes and yards. The National Cancer Institute said the study's findings would be released within the next several months. Dr. Clare B. Bradley, the commissioner of Suffolk's Department of Health Services, said the Stellman study ''doesn't close the book on these issues.'' ''It is another study that didn't show an association in that instance,'' she said. ''I am sure we will learn more from other studies moving forward.'' Suffolk County is currently preparing to seek bidders for an epidemiological study of abnormally high breast cancer rates among women under age 55 on the South Fork and in the Riverhead and Westhampton Beach areas. At the same time, the Stellman study has raised concerns among the Long Island groups about other studies, part of the Long Island breast cancer project, that have yet to be completed. ''I am starting to become very leery of these studies,'' said Geri Barish of Baldwin, the president of One in Nine, a breast cancer group. ''I only hope they are doing them in enough depth to get good results. There is something out there we are eating and ingesting. I can't believe we are this far down the road and we still haven't come up with any good answers.''	0
